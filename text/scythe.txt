SCYTHE
1-5 PLAYERS 115 MINUTES
DESIGNED BY JAMEY STEGMAIER
ART AND WORLDBUILDING BY JAKUB ROZALSKI

Scythe is a board game set in an alternate-history 1920s.
It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor.

BACKSTORY
The ashes from the first Great War still darken the snow in 1920s Europa. The capitalistic city-state known simply as "The Factory,”
which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.
With characters from five factions converging onto a small but highly desired swath of land, who will gain fame and
fortune by establishing their empire as the leader of Eastern Europa?

OBJECT OF THE GAME
In Scythe, each player represents a character attempting to
make their faction the richest and most powerful in Eastern
Europa. Players explore and conquer territory, enlist new
recruits, produce resources and workers, build structures,
and deploy monstrous mechs. A game of Scythe typically
begins with players building up their infrastructure,
exploring the world, then engaging each other in combat.
The game progresses as players place stars (achievements)
on the board, and it ends when a player places their 6th star
on the Triumph Track. You can earn a star for accomplishing
any of the following:
Complete all 6 upgrades
Deploy all 4 mechs
Build all 4 structures
Enlist all 4 recruits
Have all 8 workers on
the board
Reveal 1 completed
objective card
Win combat (up to 2 times)
Have 18 popularity
• Have 16 power

GOAL
The goal is to have the greatest fortune at the end of the game;
a typical winning fortune is around $75. You can accumulate
coins during the game, but you will earn most of them during
end-game scoring in the following three categories:
• Every star token placed
Every territory controlled
• Every 2 resources controlled
The amount of coins you earn depends on your level on the
Popularity Track. The higher your popularity, the more coins
you will earn. You can also get a few bonus coins based on
where you built structures.

DESIGNER'S NOTE: Why the name "Scythe"? A scythe is
both an instrument of farming and a weapon of
war, which perfectly encapsulates the combination
of those two elements in the game. Your workers rely
on the protection of your military just as much as
your empire depends on the resources they produce.
"Scythe” is pronounced like "sigh" and the soft "th"
in"smooth.

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS
TERRITORY
A territory is a hex on the
board labeled with one of
the following terrain types:
FARM
FOREST
MOUNTAIN
TUNDRA
VILLAGE
LAKE
FACTORY
PRIMARY TERRAIN TYPES
4
HOME BASE
You have a home base that serves as a starting point and as a place to retreat after losing
combat.
IT'S NOT A TERRITORY: A home base is not a territory, so by default you cannot move units, build
structures, or deploy mechs onto any home base, including your own.
EXPANSION FACTIONS: There are two home bases on the game board without corresponding
pieces. These are placeholders for expansion factions.

CONTROL
You control a territory if you have at least one unit there (a character, worker, or mech) OR
if you have a structure there with no enemy characters, workers, or mechs. Only one player
at a time can control a territory.

RESOURCES
Resource tokens (wood, food, metal, and oil) remain on the board once produced. You may only spend resources from
territories you currently control.
SPEND RESOURCES FROM ANY TERRITORIES YOU CONTROL: You can spend resources on territories you control for actions related to
territories anywhere on the board. For example, you can spend 3 metal tokens you control on one or more territories to
deploy a mech on the same or a different territory (if you have a worker on that territory).
SUPPLY: When you spend a resource, remove it from the board and place it in the general supply at the side of the board.
When you produce or trade for a resource (details in the Top-Row Actions section, pages 12-13), move it from the supply
to the territory where it was produced. There are no limits to the number of resource tokens in the game-use multiplier
tokens as needed.
WORKERS AREN'T RESOURCES. Resources are wood, food, metal, and oil. Workers are not resources.

EXAMPLE OF RESOURCE CONTROL: In this image, the Nordic
faction controls each of the territories on which
it has one of its units or structures (blue pieces,
including the character miniature with the blue
base). It can spend any of the resources on those
territories. It cannot spend the metal tokens on the
territory on the bottom left because it does not have a
unit or structure there.

# Page 5
TYPES OF UNITS
Each of the three unit types in the game-characters,
mechs, and workers-share two key similarities:
• They can move around the board (not over rivers or onto
lakes, by default).
• They can transport any number of resource tokens.
Each type of unit also has some unique traits that aren't
shared by the other unit types. These concepts will be
explained in detail later in the rules.

CHARACTER
MECHS
WORKERS
ENGAGE IN COMBAT
HAVE ENCOUNTERS
SAIN A FACTORY CARD
AT THE FACTORY
ENGAGE IN COMBAT
PICK UP AND DROP OFF
ANY NUMBER OF WORKERS
PRODUCE RESOURCES
DEPLOY MECHS
ABUILD STRUCTURES
All units can move any number of resource tokens.
By default, units can move 1 territory and can't move across rivers or onto lakes.
Whenever on your turn your character/mechs force an opponent's worker(s) to
retreat (through movement or combat), you lose one popularity per retreating worker.
In combat, attacker wins ties. Loser gains i combat card if they revealed >o power.

Characters can engage
in combat, can have
encounters, and (once per
game) gain a Factory card
if they end their movement
on the Factory. You are
represented on the board by
your character. You have been
sent on a mission by your
faction's leader to claim the
uncharted lands surrounding
the defunct Factory.

Mechs can engage in
combat and, when moving,
can transport any number
of workers. Mechs cannot
transport your character.
Mechs are built for war (and
for discouraging other factions
from engaging in war with
them), and they're big enough
that they can carry workers
within their iron shells.

Workers can produce
resources and more
workers, deploy mechs, and
build structures. These are
the people of the land who
have joined your cause to
build an empire for you.

PLASTIC
WOOD
A visual cue in Scythe is that tokens that take part in combat are made out of plastic
(characters and mechs). All other tokens are made out of wood to show that they do not
take part in combat (workers, resources, and structures).

QUICK-START CARD
We recommend that you don't try to teach every little
rule to new players. Instead, give each player a quick-
start card. This card contains key information about
units on one side, and the other side covers broad
concepts and gives players something specific to do for
their first five turns.
Your first game of Scythe isn't about devising a
masterful plan or understanding every little rule. Just
jump in and start pushing buttons to see how things
work, referring to the rules when necessary.
HOW TO WIN: Have the most coins,
including end-game coins from
the Popularity Track and structure
bonus.
TERRITORIES: You control a territory
(hex) if you have at least one unit or
structure there.
RESOURCES: Resources remain on the
board. Spend resources from only
territories you control.
YOUR TURN: Choose 1 of 4 sections on
player mat (different than previous
turn). In order, take either the top-
row action, the bottom-row action,
both, or neither. First pay the full
cost of the action (red boxes), then
gain the benefit (green boxes).
QUICK-START SUGGESTIONS
FIRST TURN: Take one of the top-row
actions that no one else has tried.
SECOND TURN: Work towards taking
both a top and bottom-row action
on the same turn.
Y
THIRD TURN: Use your faction ability (if
possible).
FOURTH TURN: Look at your objective
cards and pick one to pursue.
FIFTH TURN: Pick 1 of the 10 different
ways to place a star and try to
accomplish it.
Focus on being good at 6 specific
things so you can place your 6 stars
before anyone else.
RIVERWALK CARD
The riverwalk cards-one per player-are a reminder
as to which factions have the ability to cross into each
home territory if they unlock the Riverwalk mech
ability, as each Riverwalk ability is slightly different.
This ability is explained for each faction on
pages 15-17.

GAMEPLAY
Scythe uses an ongoing action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases). Players take
turns one after another until a player places their 6th star on the board, immediately
ending the game.
On your turn, do the following in sequential order:
1. Place your action token on a different section of your
Player Mat than where it was on your previous turn.
2. Take the top-row action on that section once (optional).
3. Take the bottom-row action on that section once (optional).
Thus, you may take a single action, both actions (from top
to bottom), or neither action (but you must still move your
action token). You may use resources gained from the top-
row action to pay for the bottom-row action. Also, you may
complete an objective card during your turn (see Objective
section, page 26).
The costs (red boxes) and benefits (green boxes) on your
Player Mat are shown by the number of empty spaces before
the action is taken. When taking an action, first pay the
cost, then gain as much or as little of the benefit as you
wish. You may only take an action once on your turn, not
multiple times.
After you've completed your turn (or as you're finalizing
your decision on a bottom-row action-it is crucial for
turns to overlap in this manner to keep the game moving
at a steady pace), the next person in clockwise order takes
their turn.

The top-row actions appear in a different order on each Player Mat, though each action is identical. The Player Mat visuals

BURLO
MOVE
Do one of the following ("/" means
"or"):
MOVE: Move up to 2 different units
you control (character, worker, or
mech) from one territory (or home
base) to one adjacent territory.
Move one, then move the other.
GAIN COIN(S): Gain $1.
Here are some important notes about how movement works:
RESOURCES AND WORKERS: Units may pick up and drop off any
number of resource tokens during a Move action.
MECHS: In addition to resources, your mechs can pick up
and drop off any number of your workers during a Move
action. If they do, this does not count as movement for
the workers, just the mech. So you could transport some
workers on a mech, and then one of those workers could
move on its own. You could also use part of your Move
action to move a worker onto a territory with a mech,
then move the mech while carrying the worker.
TUNNEL
RIVER
LAKE
RIVERS AND LAKES: By default, units may not move across rivers
or onto lakes. This rule is broken by some mech abilities
(see Mech abilities for Polania and Nordic, pages 16-17).
RIVER: A river is a body of water on the border between two
land territories.
LAKE: A lake is a body of water comprised of an entire
territory hex. It extends from the hex to any adjacent
shoreline. Thus, in the example shown here, if a player
has a special lake-movement ability, they could move
from any of the surrounding territories onto the lake.
TUNNELS: For the purposes of the Move action for any unit, all
territories with the tunnel icon ( are considered to be
adjacent to each other.
MOVING INTO OPPONENT-CONTROLLED TERRITORIES:
CONTROLLED BY WORKERS
>> If your character or mech move into a territory
controlled by an opponent's workers (and no other
units), its movement ends (even if you have a mech
ability that would allow it to move further). Each of
the opponent's workers on that territory immediately
retreats to their faction's home base, leaving behind
any resource tokens. You lose 1 popularity for each of
their workers you forced to retreat-they're not happy
with you for forcing them off their land (in the case
that you cannot reduce your popularity any further,
the workers are still forced to retreat).
>> Your workers cannot move by themselves into
territories controlled by opponent workers.
CONTROLLED BY A STRUCTURE
>> Any unit can move into a territory controlled only by
a structure. The player who controls the unit now also
controls the territory.
CONTROLLED BY CHARACTER AND/OR MECHS
>> If your character or mech move into a territory
controlled by an opponent's character and/or mechs,
its movement ends (even if you have a mech ability
that would allow it to move further). The opponent
still temporarily controls that territory. After you've
completed all Move actions, if any of your mechs or
your character share a territory with an opponent's
character or mechs, combat happens (see Combat
section, pages 22-23).
> Your workers cannot move by themselves into or out
of territories controlled by opponent characters and/
or mechs.
HOME BASE: By default, you may not use the Move action
to move any unit from the board into any home base
(including yours).
ENCOUNTERS: If you move your character into a territory
with an encounter token, their movement ends and they
cannot move again this turn. After resolving all combats
for this turn, if your character is still in such a territory,
discard the encounter token and resolve the encounter (see
Encounters, page 24).
NO LIMIT: There is no limit to the number of same-faction
units that can be on a territory.

the trade action to pay for resources if all of your workers are on your home base.
POPULARITY: Increase your popularity by 1 on the Popularity Track. Popularity is a commodity
used in Encounters, and it determines your scoring multiplier at the end of the game.
STRATEGY TIP: While producing with workers will provide the bulk of most players' resources, trading has some
benefits over producing that should not be underestimated. For example, trading for a desired resource
is sometimes preferable to moving a worker to a territory that provides that resource. The action that you
would have spent on movement can now be used for something more productive. Trading also allows players
to access resources that aren't available in their homeland.

PRODUCE
Pay the cost (depending on what is shown on all exposed red rectangles before taking the
Produce action), choose up to 2 different territories you control, and all workers on those
territories may produce.
On the territories you selected for production, each worker may produce 1 token. The
resource token is placed on the territory where it was produced. If a worker produces
another worker (by producing on a village), after paying the Produce cost, pick up the
leftmost worker of the Produce action on your Player Mat and place it on the village.

choose to produce
on two territories
(a farm with 1

and 1 or 2 metal
on the mountain.
PAYMENT IS REQUIRED: As is the case with any action, you must be able to pay the full cost to take
the Produce action. If you don't have the coins, popularity, and/or power, you must take
other actions instead.
NO LIMIT: Any number of resource tokens or workers can be on a territory. There are no
limits to the number of resource tokens in the game. If necessary, place a multiplier token
next to resource tokens on the board.
WORKERS ARE PERMANENT: Once you have a worker on the board, you cannot return it to your
Player Mat.
It is possible-albeit very rare-that players may find themselves in a position where they cannot take any actions (if they
last took a Move action and have no coins, resources, power, or popularity). If that happens, the player must take a "dead
turn" where they choose another section of the Player Mat without taking any of the actions there. We recommend being
thrifty with coins early in the game to prevent this from happening.

BOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS
The bottom-row actions are in the same order on all Player Mats, but the costs and benefits vary. The Player Mat visuals and
the default costs and benefits explained in this section are based on the starting position of each Player Mat.
OVERLAPPING TURNS: Usually when a player starts to take the
bottom-row action (which isn't interactive but may take a few
seconds to figure out), the next player can start to take their
turn.
COINS: Most of the bottom actions give you at least one coin
when you pay to take that action. We recommend that players
take the coins before implementing the main focus of the
action so they don't forget to gain those coins. A player may
choose not to take the coins (e.g., if coins interfere with their
objective).
COMPLETING ACTIONS: Eventually you may "complete" a bottom-
row action (e.g., with the Upgrade action, at some point you
may have nothing more to upgrade). After that point you may
continue to pay the cost of the action to gain the coins (and
the recruit bonus, if applicable).
RECRUITS: Each of the bottom actions has a Recruit Ongoing
Bonus (green circle). If it is exposed, it rewards a player when
they or adjacent opponents take this action. See the Enlist
section for details (page 20).
UPGRADE
Upgrading improves the efficiency of the infrastructure in
your growing empire. The resource used to upgrade is oil.
To upgrade, pay the cost, pick up a technology cube from
any green box on your Player Mat, and place it on any empty
red box with bracketed borders. Red boxes with solid black
borders are off limits for upgrades.
EXAMPLE: You decide that you want to be able to
Produce on 3 territories instead of 2 (ignore the Mill
for this example), and you want to decrease the cost
of enlisting a recruit by 1 food. By taking the Upgrade
action, in addition to paying the oil cost and gaining
the coin benefit, pick up any technology cube from a
green box (in this case, the Produce action benefit)
and move it to any red box with bracketed borders
(in this case, the Enlist action cost).

You can deploy mechs (miniatures) to protect your workers,

To deploy a mech, pay the cost, choose any mech on your
Faction Mat, and place that mech on a territory you control

(even if your faction has mech abilities allowing your mechs to

A
RIVERWALK: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto forests and mountains.
UNDERPASS: For the purposes of Move actions for your
character and mechs, mountains you control and all
tunnels are considered to be adjacent to each other. For
example, if your mech is on a mountain, it can move from
that mountain to (a) any other mountain you control or (b)
any tunnel (or your Mine).
DISARM: Before you engage in combat on a territory with
a tunnel or your Mine, the combating opponent loses 2
power. This loss of power is reflected on the Power Track.
You may do this once per combat, not once per unit.
SPEED: Your character and mechs may move one additional
territory when moving. If any of those units move into a
territory containing an opponent's character, mech, or
worker, their movement ends and they cannot move again
this turn. Moving from one tunnel to another still counts
as 1 move, so with this ability you could move an additional
territory before or after moving through a tunnel. Your
mechs can pick up and drop off resources and workers
in the middle of a Move action when they have the Speed
ability.

SEAWORTHY: Your character and mechs can move to and from
lakes and retreat onto adjacent lakes (you may still also
retreat those units to your home base). This allows for
lake hexes to be treated the same as other territories for

transports resources onto a lake, you may not leave those
workers or resources on the lake after moving off of it, nor

BOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS
continued
BUILD
You can build structures (structure tokens) to enhance your actions, control territories,
and get end-game bonuses. The resource used to build structures is wood.
To build a structure, pay the cost, pick up any structure from your Player Mat, and place it
on a territory you control with at least one worker on it.
LIMIT 1 PER TERRITORY: Only 1 structure can be built on each territory. So if you're the first
player to build a structure on a specific territory, neither you nor any opponent may
build another structure there.
STRUCTURE CONTROL: Opponents can't use your structure abilities. You always get the abilities
from your structures even if you don't control the territories they're on (except for the
Mill--you can't Produce on the Mill's territory if you don't control that territory).
TERRITORY CONTROL: A territory with one of your structures on it is under your control even
if you have no units there. However, if an opponent's unit is on a territory with your
structure, that territory is under their control.
PERMANENCE: Structures cannot be destroyed or moved.
FACTORY: You may build on the Factory territory.
PLACES YOU CAN'T BUILD: Your home base isn't a territory, so you can't build there. You also
can't build structures on lakes.
ONGOING BONUS: The benefit revealed by removing a structure from your Player Mat is an
additional benefit you will gain when taking the top-row action directly above it in the
future.

territory with the Mill may
count as an extra (bonus)
territory for production.
The Mill will produce as if
it were a worker. If there
are actual workers on the
Mill territory, they may also
produce resources.
MINE: The Mine acts as a
tunnel that only you can use.
You may move units to and
from your Mine as if it is a
tunnel (even if an opponent
controls the territory the
Mine is on). Unlike the other
structures, this is an ongoing
ability associated with all
unit movement.
ARMORY: Whenever you take
the Trade action, also gain
1 power.
END-GAME BONUS: At the end of the game, players will gain coins for achieving the
goals shown on the structure bonus tile that was randomly selected during
setup. You gain this bonus even if you don't control the territories the structures
are on. This bonus represents how property values have strengthened your
expanding empire.

ENLIST
You can enlist new recruits (cylindrical tokens) to join your
forces. The resource used to enlist recruits is food.
ONE-TIME BONUS: To enlist a recruit, pay the cost, pick up a
recruit token from any section of your Player Mat, place
it on any open Recruit One-Time Bonus space on your
Faction Mat, and immediately gain the depicted bonus.
This represents what your new recruit is immediately
contributing to your forces. The token remains there
permanently-it can't be moved.
The four one-time bonuses are:
• Gain 2 power
Gain 2 coins
Gain 2 popularity
Draw 2 combat cards
ONGOING BONUS: In addition to the one-time bonus, each
recruit gives you a Recruit Ongoing Bonus related to the
action from which you selected the recruit token (the bonus
in the circle). This represents a skill the recruit brings to
your force.
For the rest of the game, whenever you or the player to your
immediate left or right (these players are shown in the icon
in the red circle) take the bottom-row action in the section
of the Player Mat from which the recruit was taken, you
may gain the specified bonus. Top-row actions or a similar
action on a Factory card (see Factory section, page 25) do
not count.
PLAYER ORDER: If more than one player would gain a Recruit
Ongoing Bonus, the active player goes first, followed by
the player to their left, then the player on their right. If
one of those players places their 6th star as a result, the
game immediately ends (see Game End and Scoring,
page 28).
PROCLAMATION: You must announce when you take bottom-
row actions so adjacent players know to check for
Recruit Ongoing Bonuses.
TWO-PLAYER RULES: In a 2-player game, whenever your
opponent takes an action that would give you a Recruit
Ongoing Bonus, you only gain it once.

FACTION ABILITIES
Each faction has a special ability indicated at the upper right of the Faction Mat.
RUSVIET (RELENTLESS): You may choose the same section on your Player Mat as the
previous turn(s).
The Rusviets push their people hard, day after day, to achieve their ultimate goal. While
other factions let their infrastructure take a break from turn to turn, the Rusviet faction
may choose the same section of their Player Mat as the previous turn(s). This ability
also applies to a Factory card if you have one (see Factory section).
CRIMEA (COERCION): Once per turn, you may spend 1 combat card as if it were any
1 resource token.
The Crimean faction has a longstanding tradition of selling information to the highest
bidder. They may spend 1 combat card per turn as if it were a resource to pay for
something (1 combat card = any i resource token, regardless of the number on the
combat card). Combat cards are still worth nothing at the end of the game.
NORDIC (SWIM): Your workers may move across rivers.
Nordic workers are accomplished swimmers who refuse to complain even when wading
through the coldest of waters. They may move across rivers onto any type of terrain
(except lakes). This ability applies only to workers, not the character and mechs.
POLANIA (MEANDER): Pick up to 2 options per encounter card.
Thanks to Anna's charismatic bear companion, Wojtek, the pair tend to stretch short
encounters into longer adventures. Instead of picking just 1 option per encounter card,
the Polanian faction may choose up to 2 different options per encounter card in any
order. The benefit from the first selected option may be used to pay the cost for the
second selected option. Only one encounter card is drawn.
SAXONY (DOMINATE): There is no limit to the number of stars you can place from completing
objectives or winning combat.
Saxony's methodical approach to conquering the eastern lands surrounding the
Factory is all about asserting force and completing specific missions. The Saxon faction
may complete both of their objective cards (they don't discard the second card after
achieving the first), and they are not limited to 2 combat victory stars. If Saxony has
available stars, after winning combat, they must place the star.
DESIGNER'S NOTE: One of the subtle benefits of some of these faction abilities is that they
help to teach and remind players of the global rules of Scythe...by breaking those rules.
For example, when you read that the Rusviet faction can choose the same section of their
Player Mat on subsequent turns, you also learn that under normal circumstances, you
can't choose the same section twice in a row. In a game with lots of rules to remember, I
found that these subtle reminders really help.

# Page 22
COMBAT
Combat may happen at the end of a player's Move action (after all units have moved but
before the player takes a bottom-row action). If that player's character and/or mechs share
a territory with an opponent's character and/or mechs, combat occurs. It's possible for
this to happen on multiple territories; in that case, the active player (the attacker) chooses
the order in which these combats occur.
Combat happens only between the two players whose units share a territory, either of
whom can gain a star for winning the combat. Other players may try to influence the
combating players by bribing them with coins (see
Alliances and Bribes, page 26).
NO REQUIREMENTS: You may initiate combat even if you have o
power and/or o popularity.
ATTACKER ADVANTAGE: If the attacking player has a mech ability
that impacts combat, they use that ability first, followed by
the defending player. Also, if combat results in a tie, the
attacking player wins.
SELECT POWER
Simultaneously and secretly select a number on your Power
Dial (align the number with the icon at the top right).
That is the amount of power you will spend, so you cannot
choose a number higher than the amount of power you
currently have on the Power Track. The track goes up to 16
but you can only spend up to 7 power on your Power Dial.
ADD COMBAT CARD(S) (OPTIONAL): By default, for each of your units
involved in the current combat (character and/or mechs),
you may tuck 1 combat card from your hand behind the
Power Dial. You may do this even if you select o power on
your Power Dial.
The number of combat cards you have in hand is public
information, but during combat you may conceal whether
or not you've used any of those cards. The combat deck
contains the following cards:

DESIGNER'S NOTE: You might be surprised by how few combats happen in
a game of Scythe, especially given the universal presence of mechs in
Jakub's art. However, if you look at all of the illustrations, you'll notice
that very few of the mechs are actually fighting. In that way, Scythe is
just as much about the threat of combat as it is actual combat. If your
neighbor has built up a big pool of power and combat cards, you're less
likely to attack them. Similarly, you might position workers on key
territories to dissuade more aggressive players from attacking you there
due to the loss of popularity if they win. It is this tension that exemplifies
the core theme of Scythe: the intersection of farming and war.

REVEAL
Both players reveal their Power Dials and selected combat cards simultaneously. The value provided by any combat cards
provides an additional bonus to the power you spend from the Power Track as indicated on your Power Dial.
The player with the highest total power wins the combat (ties go to the attacking player). Both players then pay the amount
of power they selected on their Power Dials, and they discard any combat cards they used face-up (you don't adjust the
Power Track for combat cards-they're just a temporary boost).
WINNER: The winner gains (or maintains) control of the
territory and all resource tokens on it. The winner also
places 1 star token in the combat space of the Triumph
Track (see Placing Stars, page 27) if they haven't already
placed 2 stars for combat victories. If the winner was the
attacker, they lose 1 popularity for each worker they forced
to retreat by initiating and winning combat. Also, if there
was an encounter token on the territory and the winner has
a character there, they now perform the encounter.
LOSER: The loser must retreat all of their units-mechs,
characters, and workers-from the combat territory to
their home base (pick up those units and put them down on
their home base). All resources those units were carrying
remain on the territory and are now under the control of
the winner. If the loser revealed at least 1 power on the
dial or through combat cards, they gain 1 combat card as
they retreat.
LIMITED STARS AND GAME END: Each player can gain a maximum
of 2 stars for winning combat (with the exception of the
Saxon player, who can gain unlimited combat victory stars),
but they may still engage in future combats after they've
achieved those 2 stars. If your 6th star is placed but you still
have a combat remaining on your turn, the game ends and
any units you moved to initiate that combat will move back
to the territory from whence they came.
BATTLE IN A LAKE: Lake battles can happen between factions
like Polania and Nordic that have activated lake-related
mech abilities. If a mech transporting workers is attacked
while on a lake and the attacker wins combat, the attacking
player loses 1 popularity for each of those workers (they are
forced to retreat with the mech to their home base).
EXAMPLE: John takes a Move action, first moving
his character onto an unoccupied farm, then
moving a mech carrying 2 workers onto a
territory controlled by Sandra. Sandra has her
character, a mech, a worker, and 3 food tokens
on that territory.
John has 10 power and Sandra has 4 (this is
shown on the Power Track on the board). John
turns his dial to select 7 power. He has one
combat unit (the mech), so he can add 1 combat
card from his hand, but he chooses not to do so.
Sandra decides to spend 4 power on her Power
Dial. She has both her character and a mech on
the territory, so she can spend up to 2 combat
cards if she wants to. She chooses to just play a
3-power card and tucks it behind her Power Dial.
When they've both finalized their decisions, they
reveal their Power Dials at the same time. Sandra
groans-she tied John's total power (7 to 7), but
attackers win ties!
So John takes over the territory and the 3 food,
and Sandra's units retreat back to her home
base. John loses 1 popularity because, as the
attacker, he forced 1 worker to retreat. John also
places a combat victory star on the board.
Sandra's only compensation is that she gets to
draw a combat card since she revealed at least 1
power on the dial or through combat cards.
23
STRATEGY TIP: Just because an opponent has a lot more power than you doesn't necessarily mean they'll
win in combat against you. They don't know how much power you will spend or the amount of power
your combat cards will add (combat cards aren't worth anything at the end of the game, so spend them
early and often). The puzzle of combat is outwitting your opponent, especially when they think they're
going to win.

# Page 24
ENCOUNTERS
As your character treks across Eastern Europa, they
will encounter a number of local people and situations.
Each encounter will present you with three options to
determine how you want to interact with the people. The
choice you make will often impact the peoples' view of you,
represented in the game by your popularity.
When you move your character onto a territory with an
encounter token on it(), their movement ends and
they cannot move again this turn. When your Move action
is completely over and you've resolved all combats (but
before you take a bottom-row action, if applicable), discard
the encounter token and draw an encounter card. Only
characters will trigger an encounter.
8
PET THE REINDEER AND FLIRT WITH THE LOCALS AT THE REFINERY: Gain $2 and 1 popularity.
STOCK UP ON OIL FOR THE JOURNEY AHEAD: Pay $2 to gain 4 oil.
CONVINCE THE SOLDIER THAT REINDEER AREN'T REAL: Pay 2 popularity to enlist 1 recruit.
Show the art to the other players and read the thematic text (the text in all caps) out
loud. Then read through the various costs and benefits on the options and choose one (you
must choose one and pay the cost if applicable, though you may gain as much of the benefit
as you'd like). After you make your selection, discard the encounter card to the bottom of
the encounter deck face-down.
REQUIRED COST AND OPTIONAL BENEFIT: If you don't have popularity or coins to pay for certain
options, those options aren't available. You may gain as much of the benefit as you like
(e.g., if a benefit would give you 2 metal and 1 worker but you don't want the worker, you
can just gain the 2 metal).
BENEFIT LOCATION: Any resources, structures, mechs, or workers you gain from the encounter
card go on the same territory as your character (i.e., where the encounter took place).
ISOLATED COST AND BENEFIT: If an encounter card instructs you to gain something or perform an
action, you do not pay any additional costs or gain additional benefits beyond those on the
encounter card, nor do you trigger any Recruit Ongoing Bonuses.
COMBAT: If a character moves onto a territory with an encounter token and an opponent's
mech, thus initiating combat, the encounter only happens after the character wins combat.
Otherwise the encounter token remains on the territory.
NUMBER: The number in the upper left corner is just for referencing the card for questions
posted on places like BoardGameGeek.com or stonemaiergames.com.
DESIGNER'S NOTE: We made a specific design decision with the beautifully illustrated
encounter cards: Rather than tell the players what they're seeing through a label or
flavor text, we'll let you use your eyes to see the scene you've stumbled upon. There's
often a lot happening in these scenes (it's usually not just one specific thing that's
happening), and the three options explain the various ways in which you can act.
Encounter cards are shown to all players when they're drawn, so your gaming group
can integrate as much or as little of the story into the way they play Scythe as they like.
We're giving you the same visual freedom you'd experience if you stumbled upon these
scenes in real life rather than restricting you to the limitations of flavor text-after all, a
picture is worth a thousand words.

# Page 25
THE FACTORY
The Factory is the centerpiece of the Scythe board. It is a place of technological innovation
and untapped power. Unlike most other territories, the Factory does not produce any
resources. At the end of the game, the Factory is worth a total of 3 territories (instead of
just 1) to the player who controls it.
When your Move action is completely finished (after winning combat if necessary), if your
character is on the Factory for the first time this game, look through the Factory cards on
the board. You must choose one card and return the rest to the board.
The first player to look at those cards will see cards equal to the number of players +1; each
subsequent player to visit the Factory with their character will see one fewer card. It's good
to get there first.
७
A
FACTORY CARDS
Each Factory card is the equivalent of a fifth section of your Player Mat (place it next to
your Player Mat).
PAY
USING FACTORY ACTIONS: The Factory card is treated as any other section on your Player Mat. On
your turn, you may place your action token on the Factory card and take one or both actions
(starting with the top-row action if you choose to take both).
GAIN
SEPARATE FROM PLAYER MAT BONUSES: Even if the Factory card action does something similar to
another action on your Player Mat, they're completely independent of one another. So you
get neither Recruit Ongoing Bonuses, Structure bonuses, nor coins from similar actions
on your Player Mat.
MOVE: All Factory cards have a bottom-row Move action. It's a little different than a standard
Move action, as it says, "Move one unit up to two times within the same Move action."
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RULES: All other rules for movement still apply, especially those
that say that the entire Move action ends if your character moves onto a territory
with an encounter token or a character/mech moves onto a territory occupied by an
opponent's unit(s).
• MINE: If you have a Mine, you may move through the Mine with this Move action.
SPEED: If you've unlocked the Speed mech ability, one of your mechs or your character
may move up to 3 territories with this Move action.
ONE-CARD LIMIT: You may have at most one Factory card (the one you choose the first time your
character goes to the Factory).
PERMANENT SELECTION: Your selection is permanent-you may not switch your Factory card for
another card if your character ends a future Move action on the Factory.
MOVE
EXAMPLE: This Factory
card allows you to
pay 1 popularity to
Enlist a recruit OR
perform an Upgrade
(or skip the top-row
action). Then you
may Move any one
unit up to two times.
STRATEGY TIP: Don't underestimate the power of being able to move every turn. Without a
Factory card, you can only move once every other turn, but once you get that card, you
become much more nimble and responsive than players without that capability.

# Page 26
OBJECTIVES
Each player starts the game with 2 objective cards that are kept secret from
the other players. You may reveal a completed objective card during your own
turn before or after you complete a top- or bottom-row action. If you do,
place 1 star token on the objective space of the Triumph Track and discard
the card along with your other objective to the bottom of the objective deck.
You can only achieve 1 objective star, unless you're the Saxon player, who can
achieve up to 2 objective stars.
You may wait to reveal your completed objective if you wish, but you must
meet the entire objective requirements at the time you reveal it.
1
MACHINE OVER MUSCLE
Have 1 Factory card, at least 1 mech,
and no more than 3 workers.
DESIGNER'S NOTE: It may seem a little odd that each player has 2 objective cards but
may only complete one of them. There are a few reasons for this. The first is that the
alternative would be to have each player draw 2 cards at the beginning of the game and
keep 1. However, I prefer not to ask players to make decisions before the game begins,
as it makes the game more welcoming to new players and gives experienced players
more freedom depending on how the game starts to play out. The second is that it
gives players the flexibility to change strategies mid-game. Maybe you were pursuing
one strategy, but that strategy didn't end up working out. No problem—you still have
another objective card to use.
ALLIANCES AND BRIBES
Players may make informal agreements (e.g., "I won't attack you this turn if you don't
attack me next turn"). The only tangible items that may be exchanged are coins. In
tournament play, coins may not be exchanged for deals or alliances.
You can't negotiate your way out of a combat that has already begun-that is, if a player
moves their character and/or mechs onto a territory you control with your character and/
or mechs, at the end of their Move action, the two of you must engage in combat (you can't
pay them off at that point, though you could try to influence the outcome). Agreements
made between players are not enforceable.
26

# Page 27
PLACING STARS
When you reach a pinnacle of empire building, your faction rewards you with a star. Stars
are worth coins at the end of the game.
Here are the ways to place stars, as shown on the Triumph Track:
• Complete all 6 upgrades
Deploy all 4 mechs
Build all 4 structures
Enlist all 4 recruits
Have all 8 workers on the
board
Reveal 1 completed
objective card
Win combat (up to 2 times)
Have 18 popularity
• Have 16 power
When you achieve one of these goals, you must place a star on the appropriate space on the
Triumph Track. You cannot lose a star after you've placed it. For example, if you place a
star for reaching 18 popularity and you later drop below 18, the star remains on the track.
By default, each player may complete each of these goals exactly one time. Having a star on
a goal does not prevent other players from placing their stars on the same goal.

x8

x16
STRATEGY TIP: You can't place more than 6 stars, so it's
generally better to focus on completing 6 specific goals
than trying to do a little of everything.

GAME END AND SCORING
The game immediately ends when a player places their 6th star token, even if they have other things they could do that
turn or other things would happen afterwards.
EDGE CASES
If the 6th star comes from taking a bottom-row action, gain
the primary benefit, the coins, and the Recruit Ongoing
Benefit before placing the star.
If you have units (character, mechs, or workers) remaining
on a territory with an opponent's units (from a Move
action), you must undo that portion of your Move action,
returning the unit(s) to the territory they moved from.
If you place a star for total popularity or total power as
a recruit bonus on an opponent's turn, that placement
happens after the opponent takes the action (e.g., build
a structure) in clockwise order and only if that opponent
didn't place their 6th star by taking that action.
SAMPLE SCORING ROUND
The first time you play Scythe, we recommend that you run
a sample scoring round during the game so players have a
feel for the actual end-game scoring in advance. After any
player places their first star, pause the game to let players
calculate their current score. This is just for the sake of
example-this scoring does not actually happen until the
end of the game.
END-GAME SCORING
Accumulate your final fortune-coins you had before
the game end was triggered plus end-game coins-to
determine the winner. You should have a mound of coins
in front of you before announcing the total to the other
players.
To determine how many coins you earn for each of the three
scoring categories, look at your level on the Popularity
Track and pick up coins for that category (do this on your
own-there is no need for a "banker").
DESIGNER'S NOTE: Scythe incentivizes players to end the game
if possible by making stars worth coins and denying
additional turns to opponents. This may result in some
opponents having one fewer overall turns than the player
who placed their final star.
VARIANT
DELAY OF GAME: Because of the various end-game scoring
categories and their connection to popularity, it's
difficult for players to determine who is in the lead (this
is intentional). However, it is possible for a player to
interrupt the game to calculate the final score for each
player as they plan out their next few moves. That's not fun
for anyone. The Delay of Game variant says that if a player
delays the game (while the game is being played, not during
end-game scoring) for more than 10 seconds by trying to
calculate the final score, they lose 2 popularity.
EXAMPLE: If you have 10 popularity, you will earn
$4 for every star you placed, $3 for each territory
you control, and $2 for every 2 resource tokens
you control. If you have 18 popularity, you score
within the 13-17 popularity level.

CHARACTERS
You are represented on the board by your character, who has been sent on a mission to make your faction's claim to the
uncharted lands surrounding the defunct Factory. Each character unit is comprised of a person and their animal companion.
While each of the characters appears to be functionally the same as the others, their unique abilities are manifested in
their respective faction and mech abilities. A full backstory for each character can be found on the Stonemaier Games
website, but here is a short description of each one:
ANNA & WOJTEK (POLANIA REPUBLIC): An expert marksman and a helpful bear, Anna and Wojtek
traveled across the countryside during the Great War, becoming living legends as they
distinguished themselves in battle and showed compassion to even the poorest farmers.
With the Factory shut down and rumors swirling about a growing Rusviet force, Anna
and Wojtek have accepted a mission to ensure the unity and independence of Polania by
securing the eastern border and patrolling the lands surrounding the Factory.
GUNTER VON DUISBURG WITH NACHT & TAG (SAXONY EMPIRE): During the war, Gunter and his wolves
led elite mech squads across the forests and mountains of Saxony and Europa. His name
was both feared and respected, and his jacket grew heavy with medals of honor. Now that
the war is over, the Emperor has asked Gunter to embark on a new adventure to the east,
where he sees a fresh opportunity to expand the Saxony foothold on the unclaimed lands
surrounding the Factory. Tag is shown on several encounter cards, but she is not part of the
character miniature.
ZEHRA & KAR (CRIMEAN KHANATE): The firstborn daughter of the Khan of the Crimean Tartars,
Zehra is able to see through her eagle's eyes, heightening her already formidable skill with
the bow. Though her father was loath to adopt the Factory's advances, he realized that the
world was changing and he could not leave the Khanate exposed to its rivals. Reluctantly, he
has tasked his daughter with an expedition to the north for the purpose of acquiring more
modern technology and ensuring lasting peace for their people.
BJORN & MOX (NORDIC KINGDOM): Bjorn, the descendant of a renowned Viking family, was saved
from perishing in a blizzard by a kindly muskox. After surviving the ordeal, Bjorn took
the creature as his mount and named him Mox. Together they embarked on a series of
adventures across the land, serving as ambassadors to other tribes, executing military
operations, and seeking out new oil reserves. The King has now sent them southward to
add new villages and farms to the kingdom, either by diplomacy or by force, as well as to
explore the Factory with the hope of gaining a technological advantage for future wars.
OLGA ROMANOVA & CHANGA (RUSVIET UNION): When Olga's first love, Viktor, went missing during
the Great War, she vowed to find him again. She joined the Rusviet military intelligence
service with Changa, her Siberian tiger, at her side. With her intelligence and ambition,
she has risen quickly through the ranks, and has used her newly-earned authority to
launch a full-blown invasion into the western lands-a desperate attempt to find her
beloved Viktor, with the full strength of the Rusviet military at her back!

HIGHLIGHTED RULES
RESOURCES: All units-characters, mechs, & workers-can carry
around resources (any number).
TURNS AND PLAYER MATS: On your turn, you must choose a different
section of your Player Mat than you did the previous turn.
Take either the top-row action, the bottom-row action, or
both (starting with the top action). First pay the full cost of the
action (all icons on exposed red boxes), then gain the benefit
(exposed green boxes). If you select a bottom-row action,
the player to your left may start to take their turn while you
decide exactly which upgrade, mech, structure, or recruit you
will gain. Remember to take the coins from the bottom-row
actions!
MOVE ACTION: You must move different units (not the same unit
multiple times). You may choose only to use part of the
Move action if you only want to move one unit. A mech can
transport workers as part of its movement, then one of those
workers could also move.
PRODUCE ACTION: Produce on 2 different territories. Each worker
on those territories may produce 1 resource token. So if you
have 3 workers on a forest and 2 workers on a farm, a Produce
action generates 3 wood on the forest and 2 food on the farm.
WORKERS: Workers are not resources, but they are produced on
villages just like resources are produced on other terrains.
Just as with any Produce action, first pay the full cost on all
exposed red boxes on the Produce action, then Produce the
worker(s) by taking the meeple from your Player Mat (left
to right). You may choose not to produce a worker, as it can
increase the cost of future Produce actions. Once produced,
workers may never return to your Player Mat.
TRADE: When taking the Trade action, choose any 2 resource
tokens (either the same or different types) and place them on
a territory you control that contains a worker.
BOLSTER: Gain power on the Power Track or draw combat card(s).
If the combat card deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to
form a new deck.
BOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS: You may continue to pay to take a bottom-row
action for the coin(s) even after you've achieved a star for the
action. This will continue to trigger Recruit Ongoing Bonuses.
UPGRADE: Pick up a technology cube from any green box on your
Player Mat and place it on any red bracketed box on your
Player Mat.
MECHS: Only mechs may carry around workers (any number of
workers)-not characters. Mech abilities apply to all mechs
and your character. Each faction has a slightly different
Riverwalk mech ability. If a mech has the Speed ability, it may
pick up and drop off workers/resources mid-movement.
RIVERWALK: Each faction has a slightly different version of the
Riverwalk ability, allowing them to move across rivers onto
two specific terrain types.
STRUCTURES: Only a single structure may be present on each
territory. Structures can't be built on lakes.
RECRUITS: Gain a One-Time Recruit Bonus when taking the
Enlist action. From then on, gain a Recruit Ongoing Bonus
whenever you or the player to your left or right take the
bottom-row action corresponding to that bonus.
COMBAT: Only characters and mechs participate in combat
(moving a character or mech onto a territory containing
an opponent's worker is not combat). Ties are won by the
attacker. If the loser of combat revealed any power during the
combat (either on the Power Dial or via combat cards), they
gain a combat card. Both the winner and loser must pay the
power they selected on the Power Dial.
RETREATING WORKERS (FORCED): You only lose popularity for forcing an
opponent's worker to retreat on your turn. That is, if you
are attacked by a mech with workers on it and you win the
combat, you do not lose 1 popularity for forcing each of those
workers to retreat. On your turn, you may force opponent
workers to retreat even if you don't have enough popularity.
ENCOUNTERS: Only characters may have encounters. To choose
an option on the encounter card, you must be able to pay the
cost (if any). All resources, units, or structures gained from
an encounter card go on the territory where the encounter
occurred. Benefits gained from encounters do not trigger
Recruit Ongoing Bonuses.
FACTORY: Only characters may claim Factory cards (1 per player).
Actions taken on Factory cards do not trigger Recruit Ongoing
Bonuses or Structure Bonuses.
OBJECTIVES: You may reveal a completed objective on your turn.
Discard the other objective card (unless you're playing
Saxony).
STAR PLACEMENT: Once a player places a star on the Triumph Track,
it cannot be removed. Having a star on a goal does not prevent
other players from placing their stars on the same goal. If
a player places their 6th star, the game immediately ends.
Nothing else happens other than end-game scoring.
END-GAME SCORING: At the end of the game, remember to include
coins you earned during the game as part of your final coin
total. When scoring for territorial control, you control a
territory and all resources on it if you have a unit there or if
you have a structure there (unless an opponent has units on
that structure's territory). Make sure to only score for every
two resource tokens you control, not every resource token.
