TOKAIDO
Object of the Game
The players are travelers in Japan in days of old. They will follow
the prestigious Tokaido and try to make this journey as rich an
experience as possible.
To do this, they will pass through magnificent countryside, taste
delicious culinary specialties, purchase souvenirs, benefit from
the virtues of hot springs, and have unforgettable encounters.

Set-up
1 Place the game board on a flat surface.
2 Place the Achievement cards face up next to the board.
3 Shuffle the Souvenir cards (black back) and make a face-down
pile.
4 Shuffle the Hot spring cards (light blue back) and make a face-
down pile.
5 Shuffle the Encounter cards (purple back) and make a face-
down pile.
6 Shuffle the Meal cards (red back) and make a face-down pile.
7 Sort the Panorama cards by type (Sea, Mountain, Paddy) and
by value (placing the 1 above the 2 above the 3...).
Place the 7 resulting piles on their corresponding locations on
the board.
8 Place the coins next to the board as the bank.

Components:
• 1 Game board
• 5 Traveler pieces
• 5 Travel point markers
• 5 Player color tokens (bags)
• 50 Coins
• 10 Traveler tiles
• 12 Hot Spring cards
• 60 Panorama cards
• 25 Meal cards
• 24 Souvenir cards
• 14 Encounter cards
• 7 Achievement cards
• 5 Reference cards

▲ Each player selects a Traveler piece and the correspondingly
colored marker and color token (bag). Place the marker on
square O of the path that records Journey points.

Each player then takes 2 Traveler tiles at random, chooses 1
and places it face up on the table before them. If this is the
first time for any player, they
C
may choose to reduce the
complexity by starting with 7
coins instead of a Traveler.

The player then places their
color token (bag) in the hole of
their Traveler tile.
D
Place all unchosen and unused
x3
tiles in the box out of play.

Each player gains coins equal
to the number in the upper
right corner of their chosen tile.

Finally, randomly place all of
the Traveler pieces in a line
at the leftmost inn (Kyoto).
Alternatively, all players
may start on the rightmost
inn (Edo) and move right to
left throughout the game.
For 2-player games, add a
third traveler-the Neutral
traveler-to the starting Inn
(see page 7).

Playing the Game
In Tokaido, the player whose Traveler is farthest behind on the
road (with respect to the destination) is the player who takes the
next turn.
This player must move their Traveler forward-that is, toward
Edo-to the open space of their choice, but not beyond the next
inn, freely passing over one or more open spaces, if they wish.
Once they have moved their Traveler, the player receives the
benefit corresponding to this type of space. (The spaces are
detailed on this page and the next page of these rules.)
In most cases, after a Traveler has moved, another Traveler is
then last on the road, and it becomes that player's turn.
Sometimes the last Traveler may still be last after moving, in
which case they go again immediately.

Way of travel
The Green traveler is farthest behind on the road, so it is their
turn to move.

サ
Way of travel
The Green traveler moves (arrow). It's now the Purple traveler's turn.
• If the Green traveler had moved and was still behind the Purple traveler,
they would have to go again.

Double spaces
Some of the spaces on the board are
doubled.
When a traveler lands on a double space,
they must occupy the space located on
the road if it is free; a Traveler who arrives
after them must occupy the second space.
Double spaces are used only in games
with 4 or 5 players and the second space
is considered farther on the road.
When playing with 2 or 3 players, the
second space-the one off the road-
cannot be occupied.

Description of the spaces
Double, space
cre
品
Single space

Each move leaves a traveler on one of the 8 types of spaces or
one of the Inn spaces. In the descriptions below, a "collection"
refers to all of the cards acquired (and placed face up) by a
player during a game.
Note: Travelers immediately score all points earned during the
journey.

Way of travel
The Purple traveler is farther behind than the Green traveler,
therefore it is their turn to move.

Shop
The player draws 3 Souvenir cards and reveals them. They may
purchase 1 or more of these cards by paying the price indicated
on each card.
They then place any unpurchased cards face down on the
bottom of the pile. Each Souvenir is different, and each belongs
to one of 4 types: small objects clothing, art, and food
& drinks

Souvenirs cost 1, 2 or 3 coins. They are worth 1, 3, 5 or 7 points depending
on the actual Souvenirs in a player's collection.
10/29/24 11:58 AM

# Page 4
To maximize points, players need to collect Souvenirs in sets
containing each type of Souvenir. (Note that you can purchase
and score for Souvenirs of any type.)
As you purchase Souvenir cards, group them into sets in front of
you; each set can contain only one Souvenir of each type.
The first Souvenir in a set, no matter which type it is, is
worth 1 point.
The second Souvenir in a set, which must be of a different type
than the first, is worth 3 points.
The third Souvenir in a set, which must be of a different type
than the first two, is worth 5 points.
The fourth Souvenir in a set, which must be of a different type
than the first three, is worth 7 points.
The player earns these points at the time that they add these
cards to their collection. (Examples of souvenir collecting and
the points earned are given below.)
Note:
A traveler must have at least 1 coin to stop in a Shop, but they
are not required to purchase any souvenirs.
A traveler may work on several sets in parallel. It is not necessary
to finish a set before starting a new one.

Panorama
Panoramas are made of 3, 4 or 5 sections.
When a player stops on a Panorama Station, if they don't yet have any
panorama cards of this type, they gain a Panorama card of value "1".
Otherwise, they gain the next higher point value card.
They immediately score a number of points equal to the value
of the card (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 depending on the panorama).

Temple
The player donates 1, 2, or 3 of
their coins to the temple, placing
them on the Temple section of the
board in the area corresponding to
their color. They immediately score
1 point for each donated coin.

Note: A traveler who stops on a Temple space must donate at
least 1 coin as an offering and cannot donate more than 3 coins.
It's forbidden to stop and give nothing.

Encounters

appropriate type. If they have started it, they
gain the next number in ascending order. If
they have completed it, they can start or add to
a different panorama of their choice. They score
points for the Panorama card as usual.

The Inns are special spaces, and all Travelers must stop at each Inn.
The Inns are the places where players can buy Meal cards. Meal
cards cost 1, 2 or 3 coins and all give 6 victory points.

Arriving at an Inn
Fugu
The Inns, mandatory stopovers for all
travelers, are places to enjoy a well-earned
meal and sample local culinary specialties.
Each traveler is obliged to stop at each of
the 4 Inns on the way to Edo, so naturally
the Inn spaces can hold all of the travelers
at the same time.
These Inn spaces are on the board in red.
The order that players arrive at an Inn
is important.
The first traveler occupies the space
nearest the road, and later travelers form
a line after them.

The green traveler
will be the first one
to leave the Inn.
When the first traveler arrives at an Inn, they draw as many
Meal cards as there are players, plus 1. (For example, in a game
with 3 players, they draw 4 cards.)
They look at these cards without showing them to other players.
They may then purchase one Meal card of their choice by paying
the price (1, 2, or 3 coins) marked on the card.
They add this card, face up, to their collection and place the
remaining cards next to the board, face down.
Each Meal card is worth 6 points, which are immediately scored.
They then must wait for the other travelers to arrive at the Inn.
Upon arrival, each traveler may purchase one of the remaining
Meal cards, if they can afford to.
The first traveler to arrive at the Inn therefore has a greater
range of choices than the last!
Important:
• A traveler cannot taste the same culinary specialty twice
during their journey.
• A traveler can never purchase more than one Meal card per Inn.
• A traveler is never required to purchase a Meal card.

Example:
In a game with four players, the first traveler arrives at the Inn;
they draw 5 Meal cards (4 players + 1) and choose their Meal
from among these 5 cards.
The second traveler arrives at the Inn; they choose their Meal
from among the 4 remaining cards.
The third traveler arrives at the Inn; they would like to choose
a Meal from among the 3 remaining cards, but they don't have
enough money to pay! Alas, they cannot take a Meal card and
go hungry at this stop.
The fourth traveler arrives at the Inn with 3 Meal cards from
which to choose as the previous traveler did not purchase a
Meal. They purchase one, then place the remaining cards at the
bottom of the pile.

Continuing the Journey
Once all travelers have arrived at the Inn and had a chance to
taste the local cuisine, the journey can continue.
• Place unpurchased Meal cards on the bottom of the
appropriate pile.
• The last traveler on the route-that is, the one farthest from
the Inn-takes the next turn and starts out on the road again.

End of the Journey
When all of the travelers have arrived in Edo at the last Inn,
the game ends after each Traveler has the opportunity to buy
one last meal card.
Award the achievement cards (Gourmet, Collector, Bather,
Chatterbox) to the appropriate travelers. (See page 6.)

The travelers score additional points depending on their ranking
as donors to the Temple.
The most generous donor scores 10 points.
The second scores 7 points.
The third scores 4 points.
All other donors score 2 points.
In the event of a tie, all tied players score points from that rank;
e.g., two players tied for first place score 10 points each.
Travelers who haven't donated a single coin to the Temple do
not score any points.

Other achievement cards
These cards are awarded to players at the end of the journey.
If two or more travelers are tied for first for any of the
achievements, they each score 3 points.

Bather
The traveler who has the most Hot Spring
cards receives this achievement card and

The player with the most points wins the game. In the event of a
tie, the tied player with the most achievement cards wins.

Chatterbox
The traveler who has the most Encounter cards
receives this achievement card and scores 3
points.

Collector
The traveler who has the most Souvenir cards
receives this achievement card and scores 3
points.

Gourmet
The traveler with the highest sum of coin costs
on their Meal cards receives this achievement
card and scores 3 points.

In Tokaido, Journey points are scored throughout the game.
However, if you think you have made a mistake, your collection
allows you to recount your points at the end of the game.

Achievement Cards
Seven achievement cards are distributed to the travelers, 3
during the game and 4 at the end of it.

Panorama achievement cards
Three cards are given during the travel to Edo.
The first traveler to complete a panorama of a particular type
receives the achievement card corresponding to this panorama.
Panorama achievement cards immediately score 3 points.

Description of the Travelers
Chuubei the messenger
When Chuubei arrives at each of the 3
intermediate Inns, before the Meal he draws 1
Encounter card and applies its effect.

Hiroshige the artist
When Hiroshige arrives at each of the 3
intermediate Inns, before the Meal he gains any
sequential panorama card.

Hirotada the priest
Each time he stops at the Temple, Hirotada can
gain 1 coin from the reserve and donate it to the
Temple, scoring 1 point for this coin. This is in
addition to the 1, 2, or 3 coins he can donate to
the Temple.

Kinko the ronin
Each Meal card purchased by Kinko costs one
coin less. (Meals that cost 1 are therefore free.)

Mitsukuni the old man
Mitsukuni earns 1 additional point for each Hot
Spring card and each achievement card.

Special Rules for 2-Player Games
Two-player games have slightly different rules.
During set-up, add a third traveler-the Neutral traveler-to
the starting Inn. (Determine the order of the three travelers at
random.)
As with the travelers controlled by players, this Neutral traveler
must be moved when they are last on the road.
The traveler who is furthest ahead on the road decides where
the Neutral traveler moves.
Note: Neutral traveler movements are an important part of
two-player games and are the key to winning!

Sasayakko the geisha
In the Shop, if Sasayakko purchases at least 2
Souvenir cards, the cheapest Souvenir is free.
Note: She must have the coins on hand to pay
for all Souvenirs, but she doesn't pay for the
cheapest one.

Satsuki the orphan
When she arrives at an Inn, Satsuki receives the
first Meal card from the Meal cards pile for free.
Note: After seeing the Meal offered to her, she
can instead purchase a Meal as normal following
the usual rule.

Umegae the street entertainer
Umegae earns 1 point and 1 coin for each
Encounter.
Note: This gain happens before applying the
effects of the Encounter card picked.

Yoshiyasu the functionary
During each Encounter, Yoshiyasu draws 2
Encounter cards, keeps 1, then places the other
card at the bottom of the pile (without showing it
to the other players).

#
Way of travel
The Neutral traveler is green in this example N. Because they are in last
place on the road, it's their turn to move. The Yellow traveler, as the player
who is furthest ahead on the road, decides where the Neutral traveler
moves.
Neutral traveler movements have no effect on the game, except
at Temple and Inn spaces.
When the Neutral traveler stops on a Temple
space, take a coin from the bank and place it on
the space corresponding to their color. Thus, the
Neutral traveler is involved at the end of the game
when calculating the additional points connected to
Temple offerings.
With two players, the first player at the Inn draws
four Meal cards. When the Neutral traveler stops on
an Inn space, the player who moved them takes the
Meal cards and discards one at random. Place this
card on the bottom of the pile without revealing it.
Excepting these two cases, the rest of the game plays with the
usual rules.

A few words about Japan...
Tokaido
The Tokaido road, which dates back to the 11th century,
connects the two most important cities in Japan: Edo (today
called Tokyo) and Kyoto.
It is 500km long and follows the southern coast of the biggest
island in the Japanese archipelago, Honshu.
Travelers in the 17th century took approximately two weeks to
complete the route, usually on foot, sometimes on horseback,
and more rarely in litters (for the wealthiest).
There were 53 stages to the route, and a number of inns
were located along the road where travelers could rest and
stock up on supplies. The road and inns inspired a number of
artists, among them the famous Hiroshige, who produced a
series of woodcut prints: Tokaido Gojusan Tsugi no Uchi (The
fifty-three stations of the Tokaido).

Panoramas
Japan is three-quarters mountainous, including a number of
volcanoes, some still active today. As a result, there is little
arable space, which is mainly taken up by rice paddies.
The Japanese coastline is thousands of kilometers long and
extremely varied, with vistas over the seas surrounding the
country. This particular geography has given the sea a special
place in the hearts of the inhabitants and artists.

Hot springs
There are many natural hot springs (Onsen in Japanese)
in the country, and they are very popular. Most have been
transformed into baths, both public and private, and they
are sometimes used to cook eggs and vegetables!
On the island of Hokkaido (in the north of the archipelago),
one often finds springs occupied by macaques, who seem
to appreciate their beneficial effects in the same way that
humans do...

Cuisine
Traditional Japanese cuisine consists of meat, fish, rice,
noodles, vegetables, and algae.
The dish best known outside the borders is sushi (sliced raw
fish on a serving of aromatic rice), but each region of Japan
has varied and savory specialties. The cuisine and the meal
is a powerful symbol in Japanese culture.
The most popular drinks are, of course, sake (rice alcohol,
actually called nihonshu in Japanese) and tea. There is a rich
variety of both, with some flavors that only connoisseurs can
truly appreciate.

Souvenirs
When traveling to visit someone in Japan, it is customary to
bring a souvenir (Omiyage in Japanese).
Here are suggested souvenirs in different categories and their
Japanese names: Small objects-chopsticks (Hashi), tops
(Koma); Clothing-hats (Boshi), wooden sandals (Geta);
Food & drink-pastries (Manju), candies (Kompeito); Art-
boxes (Hako), laquer (Urushi), prints (Ukiyo-e), sculptures
(Netsuke), musical instruments (Gakki).
