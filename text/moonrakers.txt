INTRODUCTION
Moonrakers is a game of shipbuilding, temporary alliances,
and shrewd negotiation set in a space-faring future.
Players form a loose band of mercenaries
called the Moonrakers, but while they are
united in name, actual alliances are shaky
as players are pitted against each other
in the quest to become the new leader of
the Moonrakers.

GAME OVERVIEW
Moonrakers is a deck building game in
which players choose Contracts to attempt
alone or with Allies in order to gain
Prestige and Credits. After negotiating
terms with potential Allies, players use
their Action Decks to play Thrusters,
Shields, Weapons, Reactors, and
Crew to fulfill the requirements on each
Contract. Each type of card has other
effects to keep turns going, such as extra
Actions, additional cards, and protection
from ▲ Hazards encountered while
attempting Contracts.
Players build powerful Action Decks and
special abilities by upgrading their ships
and hiring Crew with the Credits they
receive from completing Contracts. This
helps them accomplish more difficult and
rewarding Contracts alone, which lets them
keep more Prestige for themselves.
Who will receive the Prestige, Credits, and
risk of ▲ Hazard from Contracts is all
negotiable between Allies, but if players
don't make their offers enticing enough,
other players may be tempted to betray
them! The first player to reach 10 Prestige
wins, but be careful... running into
▲ Hazards on Contracts reduces Prestige!

Ship Parts and guidelines for each of
their Draw, Discard, and Objective card
piles.
To start, each player shuffles an Action Deck of:
- 2 Damage 1 cards
- 3 Reactor cards
- 2 Shield cards
- 2 Thruster cards
- 1 Miss cards
This deck should be placed on the left side of the
player's Command Terminal. Action Cards not in use in
players' starting decks should be put within reach for
later. Each player draws 5 cards from their Action
Deck.

GAMEPLAY > MISSION LEADER
The Mission Leader
Players take turns as the Mission Leader. To determine who goes
first, all players roll all 4
Hazard Dice. The player that rolls the
least ▲ Hazard goes first. In the event of a tie, roll again. The
Mission Leader's turn consists of 3 phases: Planning, Execution,
and Buying.
GAMEPLAY > SCORING PRESTIGE
Completing Contracts
Each Contract has a Prestige reward value
in the upper right corner. Players are
awarded that number of Prestige upon
successful completion of the Contract.
If multiple players attempt a Contract
together, they negotiate ahead of time who
is awarded some or all of the Prestige upon
successful completion of the Contract.
Prestige is tallied on the Dispatch Board by
moving a player's Ship Token up or down the
Prestige Tracker.

GAMEPLAY > SCORING PRESTIGE
Fulfilling Objective Cards
An Objective card is a private contract that a player can claim any
time, during any player's turn, when its conditions are met. To claim
an Objective, a player reveals it, shows its conditions have been
met, and gains 1 Prestige. If a player forgets
to claim an Objective, they have to meet its
conditions again to claim it.
Objectives should be scored at the end of
a turn. A Hazards do not affect Objective
cards. For example, if a player drops to
O Prestige from A Hazard on their turn
but shows the conditions of an Objective
have been met, the player will still gain
1 Prestige from the Objective even if it
would have been canceled out by
extra
Hazard.

GAMEPLAY > PLANNING PHASE
At the start of the Planning Phase, the Mission
Leader has two options: Choose a Contract or
Stay at Base.
Option 1: Choose a Contract
The Mission Leader may choose any of the
faceup Contract cards next to the Dispatch
Board and place it on the table for potential
Allies to see.
To complete a Contract, the Mission Leader
and any Allies must meet the requirements by
playing an equal or greater number of Action
Cards that match the icons on the bottom of
the Contract card.
When choosing a contract, the Mission
Leader should:
Analyze the requirements on the bottom left
of the Contract card and compare them to the
cards in their current hand of Action Cards.
Decide which rewards benefit them the most.
There are 3 possible rewards found in the
upper right corner of the card for successfully
completing a Contract: Prestige, Credits, and a
Bonus Card. (See pg. 22)
Weigh the risk of the
Hazard Dice. Each
Contract requires a player to roll 0-4 dice.
(See pg. 18)
NOTE
During the Planning Phase, the Mission
Leader may choose to pay 1 Credit to
return an available Contract to the
bottom of the Contract draw pile and
replace it with a new one from the top.
This may only be done once per turn.

# Page 17
Forming Alliances
Moonrakers / Articles of Agreement S Gameplay / Planning Phase
GAMEPLAY > PLANNING PHASE
After selecting a Contract, the Mission Leader
may attempt the Contract alone or invite
others to join as an Ally. Multiple players may
join a Contract as Allies.
If another player chooses to join the Contract
as an Ally, they play their active hand as they
would on their own turn, contributing any
Action Cards and Ship Part specials (except
those that say as Mission Leader) to the
Contract requirements. Benefits from playing
action cards like Shields, Reactors, and
Thrusters only affect the player that plays
them; these benefits do not help Allies unless a
special ability specifically states it.
CONTRACT.IMG
NOTE
Allies are not required to be honest
about what they will do on a Contract, so
be careful. Players cannot reveal any
cards from their hand before the
Hazard Dice are rolled.
Players can negotiate over anything that
appears on a Contract, including Prestige,
Credits, Bonus Cards, and who rolls the
Hazard Dice. Players cannot negotiate over
any prestige, cards, or credits already owned.
If players can't agree, the Mission Leader can
pick a new contract, but they can only
negotiate for help on up to two Contracts per
turn. They must solo a Contract for their third
selection or choose to Stay at Base.

Option 2: Stay At Base
The Mission Leader may also decide to not
attempt a Contract and instead to Stay at
Base. Mission Leaders who choose this option
perform the following:
1) Draw two new Objective cards. Keep one,
and discard the other to the bottom of the
Objective deck.
2) Collect 1 Credit for protecting the base.
3) Skip the Execution Phase and proceed
directly to the Buying Phase.
4) If desired, replace an available Contract with
one from the top of the Contract Deck.
5) Discard the active hand of Action Cards and
draw 5 more.

Attempt the Contract
At the bottom of each Contract card are the required Action Cards that must be played in order to
complete it.
The Mission Leader and any Allies contribute to
the Contract requirements by playing their
Action Cards and using any relevant Ship
Part special abilities. The Mission Leader
decides the order of play between any Allies.
The Mission Leader may also decide if players
play cards at the same time or pause to let
other players play.
NOTE
There is no rule requiring allies to
help a Contract succeed. They may
choose to withhold cards, lie, etc.
Playing Action Cards
GAMEPLAY > EXECUTION PHASE
All players begin the Execution Phase with 1 Action, which allows the player to play 1 Action Card.
+ Reactor cards give players an additional 2 Actions, allowing the player to play additional Action
Cards. Some Ship Parts and Crew cards also add additional Actions that can be used.
A player may continue playing Action Cards until they run out of Actions, or run out of Action Cards to
play from their hand.
Players may not:
Play additional Action Cards after they've run out of Actions, even if a card in their hand would
provide additional Actions.
Draw additional cards if they run out of Action Cards, even if they have unused Actions.
NOTE
If a player needs to draw a card but his or her Draw Pile is empty,
the player will shuffle their Discard Pile, put it facedown as their
new Draw Pile, and continue to draw as normal.

GAMEPLAY > EXAMPLE
Example of Playing a Contract:
[1] The Mission Leader is soloing the contract
"Claim Bounty". It requires 2 Damage and
24 Reactors, with 14 Hazard Dice.
[2] They roll a single A Hazard icon, which means
they'll be losing a Prestige point at the end of the
Contract if they are unable to play a Shield.
[3] In their hand, they have a
Reactor, a X Miss, a
a

Shield.

Damage I, and
[4] The Mission Leader begins by playing their

but adds 2 additional Actions. This also fulfills half
of the
Reactor requirement of the Contract.

[3]

[5] The Mission Leader then plays their

They draw the top 2 cards of their draw pile:

Reactor
+2 Actions
a Reactor and a
Damage III.
[6] The Mission Leader then uses their remaining
Action to play a Reactor card, giving them 2
additional Actions. This fufills the second
Reactor requirement on the Contract.
[7] Next, they play their Damage III, fulfilling the
Contract's 2 Damage requirement, succesfully
completing the Contract.
[8] Finally, they play a
Action, blocking the
Shield with their last
Hazard rolled in Step 2 that
would have reduced their Prestige by 1.

GAMEPLAY > EXECUTION PHASE
Contract Success
A Contract is successfully completed when the requirements on the Contract card have been
fulfilled.
Players may continue to play Action Cards after a Contract has been completed, as long as they
have available Actions to do so. It can be helpful to play additional Shields to cover any unblocked
Hazard.
Once all players have finished playing their Action Cards, players collect the rewards listed at the
top right of the Contract per the previously negotiated terms. Players must honor the negotiated
terms.
2
Prestige is immediately
added to the Prestige
Tracker.
5
Credits are immediately
taken from the Vault and
placed on the players'
Command Terminals.
Bonus Cards are drawn from
①

the top of the Crew or Ship
Part decks. These may be
discarded if unwanted.
Contract Failure
A Contract is failed when all players attempting the Contract have played all the Action Cards they
can/desire to and have not fulfilled the requirements on the Contract.
When a Contract has been failed, players receive none of the rewards from the Contract. There are
no other negative consequences for failing a Contract, but Hazard dice still reduce a players Prestige
if unblocked by Shields or special abilities.
Regardless of Success or Failure:
All players subtract their A Hazard that was not blocked by a Shield from their total Prestige.
Note: Players cannot drop below zero Prestige.
All players who attempted the Contract discard their cards. This includes all played Action Cards in
the play area and any Action Cards still remaining in their active hands.
All Allies draw 5 cards from their draw pile.
The Contract Card is discarded to a pile near the Dispatch Board and a new Contract is drawn and
added to the row of available Contracts.
The Mission Leader now proceeds to the Buying Phase.

# Page 27
Moonrakers / Articles of Agreement / Gameplay / Action Deck Management
Action Tree Example
Using an Action Tree can be helpful to
keep track of used and remaining
Actions while attempting a Contract.
In this example, the player began by
using their starting Action to play a
Reactor, gaining two more Actions.
The player tracked those actions by
playing the cards on the lower corners
of the first Reactor.
This "tree" continues each time a player
places another Reactor or other
cards that gain the player Actions.
Keep in mind that some Allies or
Ship Parts can also give players
additional Actions. They can be tracked

Ending the Game
GAMEPLAY > ENDING THE GAME
The first player to have 10 Prestige at the end
of any player's turn wins the game. The
winning player is the new leader of the
Moonrakers.
Tiebreaker
If two players reach 10 Prestige on the same
turn, the tie is broken by the player with the
highest net worth, calculated by adding up the
value of Ship Parts, Crew members, and the
player's store of Credits.
GAMEPLAY > STRATEGY NOTES
Ally Early and Often
In the early game, ask for help on Contracts as
often as possible. Failing a Contract alone is
much worse than sharing a bit of the reward.
When you aren't the Mission Leader, offer your
help on Contracts. As the game progresses,
it's often not a good idea to ally with the player
who has the most Prestige.
Build a Balanced Deck
Over the course of the game, prepare to be
able to do Contracts alone. In the beginning of
the game, you can rely on Allies, but toward
the end of the game, you'll be able to get ahead
by soloing Contracts. This requires a well-bal-
anced ship. If you buy too many Ship Parts with
Damage and Shields, you may not have
enough Reactors to give you the Actions to
play them.
Bad Hand?
If you have a bad hand, try to find someone to
ally with, allowing you to get a new set of cards
for your next turn.
Soloing Contracts
Before attempting a Contract alone, be sure to
double check that you have enough cards in
your Action Deck to complete the Contract. In
your Command Terminal, you can see all of the
cards you currently have in your deck:
Check "Default Loadout" to see the cards you
started the game with.
Check your installed Ship Parts to see the
cards they've added to your Action Deck.
Remember any Crew you've hired and their
abilities.
Check the requirements of the Contract again
and make sure you've got what it takes. If you
don't, find an Ally or try an easier Contract.
Plan for Hazard Dice
When planning to attempt a Contract with a
high number of A Hazard Dice, make sure
you save a few extra Actions to play
Shields. If you don't plan well, you may end
up completing the Contract but lose Prestige.

Moonrakers / Articles of Agreement / Gameplay / House Rules & Single Player
GAMEPLAY > HOUSE RULES
Ambiguity Rule
Some playtesters prefered playing the game
without explicitly stating what cards were in their
hands. In this variant, players may not use
specific numbers when talking about the cards in
their hands. A player might say, "I can do some
Damage," instead of "I can do 2 Damage."
Timed Negotiations
Some groups' playtimes were much longer than
others due to players taking too long to negotiate
alliances. In order to speed this up, a timer of 1-2
minutes can be added to time the negotiation
phase. Note, players can still negotiate over a
total of two Contracts before deciding to solo a
contract or stay at base so if they time out of
their first Contract, they can select a second and
try again before having to decide to solo a
Contract or stay at base.
GAMEPLAY > SINGLE PLAYER
Setup
Set the game up according to the rules at the
beginning of the manual.
In addition to the player's Ship Token, a
separate Ship Token of a different color should
be placed on the 1 slot of the Prestige Tracker.
This will be used to track the current round.
The solo mode also needs an additional deck of
cards, called the Mercenary Deck.
Create this deck from:
- 2
Damage I cards
-1
Damage II cards
- 3 Reactors cards
- 3 Shields cards
- 3 Thrusters cards
-3 random Crew cards
Shuffle these together and place them in
reach of the player.

GAMEPLAY > SINGLE PLAYER
Mercenary Deck
At the start of the game, deal 5 random cards
from the Mercenary Deck in a row next to it.
The player can use these cards to reduce
Contract requirements by bartering rewards on
the Contract - exactly as if they were an ally.
Each Crew costs 1 Prestige to use, and each
Action Deck card requires 1 Credit to use and an
additional Credit for each card you've used that
round. For example, the second card would cost
2 Credits, the third would cost 3, and so on.
These payments come from the rewards listed in
the Contract the player is attempting.
NOTE
Mercenary cards do not cost
an Action to use.
played it themselves, in addition to it counting
toward a Crew Requirement.
These cards do not enter a player's deck, but
instead, are marked as played by placing the
number of Credits needed to use them on top of
the card. Use "3" Credits to represent a Prestige
being used on the Crew members.
After each turn, discard the 5 cards and deal out
5 new cards. Shuffle the Mercenary deck
discard pile once all of the cards have been used,
and use it as the new draw pile.
Instead of discarding a Crew member card
from the Mercenary deck, return it to the bottom
of the Crew deck on the Armory Board. Then
place the top Crew card of the Crew deck in
the discard pile of the Mercenary deck.
The player does not get the benefit of Mercenary
Action Deck cards; they only apply to the
Contract requirement. For example, if the player
pays to use a Thruster from the Mercenary deck
it only reduces the Contract requirement, the
player does not draw two cards from their Draw
pile or the Mercenary Deck.
The player does get to use the special ability of
any Crew hired for the Contract as if they had
Gameplay
The player is trying to score as many points as
possible in 10 rounds.
The player is the Mission Leader for every round
and follows the base game rules for selecting
and attempting Contracts, with the addition of
the Mercenary Deck rules above.
After each Buying Phase, move the second Ship
Token up 1 space. After the 10th round ends, the
game is immediately over.

# Page 31
Misc. Rules
Moonrakers / Articles of Agreement / Gameplay / Single Player & Two Players
GAMEPLAY > SINGLE PLAYER
Players may choose to remove 4 Hazard Dice
Contracts from the deck.
Any Objective card that references Allies is
instead referencing the Mercenary Deck. So if
any Objective says to complete a Contract alone,
players may not use the Mercenary Deck on that
Contract if you want to accomplish the Objective.
Any Ship Part or
Crew referencing Allies can
be discarded for free.
Players may not use Credits from their supply or
Prestige they have already won to hire Merce-
nary Cards, but can only use rewards on the
Contract the player is attempting.
Scoring
At the end of the 10 rounds, the player counts
up their points to see how they stack up
against the competition!
Each Prestige point is worth 10 points at the
end of the game. Players can obtain more than
10 Prestige by tracking additional Prestige
with a second Ship Token or by beginning again
at 0.
Each Credit is worth 1 point. At the end of the
game, add the total value of Ship Parts and
Crew with any remaining unspent Credits and
add that number to the total score.

Rules
GAMEPLAY > TWO PLAYERS
The 2 player variant operates very similarly to
the base game. It's still a race to 10 prestige and
players can still work together.
Setup
Create a Mercenary Deck following the rules in
the solo mode. The players will use the
Mercenary Deck ruleset from the solo mode with
a couple of additions:
1) Only the Mission Leader can use the
Mercenary Deck. Payment for using the
Mercenary Deck comes out of what the Mission
Leader negotiated for. The Ally cannot use the
Mercenary Deck or contribute to the payment
for using it.
2) The same Mercenary Deck cards stay out
until both players have had their turn. Even if one
player uses the cards, they can still be used by
the second player on their turn. After the second
player has had their turn, discard the 5 next to
the pile and deal 5 more.
