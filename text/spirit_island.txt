## Page 3
You are powerful Spirits of the natural world, existing on an isolated island. Invaders from beyond the known sea
have recently begun their colonization of your island, killing the native islanders - a people called the Dahan - and
upsetting the natural balance. The Spirits of the island must grow in power and throw back the Invaders before the
island is blighted beyond hope of recovery!
GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW
Spirit Island is a cooperative game for 1-4 players where each player is a Spirit of nature, defending their island from invading colonists
who have little regard for the well-being of the land or its native inhabitants, the Dahan. Every turn, all Spirits act simultaneously,
employing Powers to push the Invaders back, bolster the island, and aid the Dahan. But the Spirits start out small and limited, and
will have to learn some new tricks in order to catch up to the rapidly expanding Invaders, whose Actions (automated by the game)
drive them to spread across the Island and establish settlements, spreading Blight in their path. To win, the Spirits (with the help of the
Dahan) must destroy the Invaders and scare away any survivors. However, the game will end in defeat if the island is overrun by Blight,
if any Spirit is destroyed completely, or if you act too slowly and fail to drive the Invaders off before they become entrenched.
Once you know the game, Spirit Island takes about 90-120 minutes to play - slightly shorter for games with 1-2 players, slightly longer
for games with 4.
HOW TO READ THIS RULEBOOK
The rules are divided into three major sections: Game Setup, Sequence of Play, and Game Concepts. Read Game Setup first. Then
read Sequence of Play and Game Concepts in the order that best suits your learning style. Sequence of Play will introduce you to the
overall game structure while Game Concepts drills down into individual game mechanics.
FIRST-TIME PLAYERS
Spirit Island is a complex game with many moving parts. The first time or two you play, you should:
• Choose a low-complexity Spirit. (Lightning's Swift Strike, Vital Strength of the Earth, River Surges in Sunlight, or Shadows Flicker
Like Flame.)
• Take the Power Progression Card for your Spirit. Set aside all the Minor and Major Powers listed on the card. During the game,
when you gain a new Power Card, add the next Power Card on the list to your hand instead of using the standard method.
If everyone is playing the game for the first time, also:
• Don't use a Blight Card. Instead, use the pre-printed Blight space on the board.
• Don't use an Adversary or Scenario. They increase difficulty and add additional rules.
Whenever your group is ready for a more challenging game, we recommend the Kingdom of Brandenburg-Prussia as a good
first Adversary - it mostly modifies setup rather than introducing new rules. The Kingdoms of England and Sweden involve more
fundamental changes to how the Invaders work.

GAME SETUP
TERROR LEVEL
TERROR LEVEL
FEAR
The Fear Deck should look like this when splayed out.
MAKING THE INVADER DECK
The Invader Deck is 12 cards:
• 3 Stage I cards on top, then
• 4 Stage II cards, then
• 5 Stage III cards on the bottom.
Mix up the cards from each Stage and choose
without looking at them, putting unused cards
back in the box. (The game comes with 4 Stage I
cards, 5 Stage II cards, and 6 Stage III cards, so
you can just remove one of each.)
3-PLAYER MAP
2-PLAYER MAP
For most games of Spirit Island, Setup proceeds as below. However, when setting up Spirit Island
using an Adversary and/or Scenario, select them first, as they can change how the game is set up.
To set up the Invader Board:
INVADER BOARD
1. Place the Invader Board on one side of the play area.
2. Put 4 Fear Markers per player into the Fear Pool.
3. Shuffle the Fear Cards and put 9 on the Fear Deck Space. Place the "Terror Level 3" divider 3 cards
from the bottom and the "Terror Level 2 divider 3 cards above that, so the deck is divided into 3
groups of 3 cards each.
4. Make the Invader Deck and put it on the Invader Board on the Explore Action Space (see sidebar).
5. Take a random Blight Card and place it on top of the Blight Space on the board, "Healthy Island"
side up, without looking at the back. If you are not using a Blight Card, use the Blight instructions
printed on the Invader Board instead. Place the shown amount of Blight onto the card.
To set up the island:
THE ISLAND AND SUPPLY
• Randomly pick one Island Board per player and arrange them to form the Island (see sidebar).
• Populate the Island Boards with Invaders, Dahan, and Blight (from the box, not the Blight
Card) as indicated by the icons in each land.
To set up the Supply:
• Shuffle the Minor and Major Power Decks. Put them near the board with room for each deck to
have a discard pile.
• Put the Energy, Cities, Towns, Explorers, and the Dahan near the board. Make sure all players
can reach them; you may need multiple piles.
PLAYER SETUP
Each player takes all Spirit Presence and Single-Turn Effect Markers of one color, then chooses a
Spirit by taking a Spirit Panel and its four Unique Power Cards, which is their starting hand. New
players should choose a low-complexity Spirit and take its Power Progression Card, as described
on p. 3.
Each player starts on a different island board and follows Setup instructions on the back of their
Spirit Panel. This always includes putting Presence into one or more lands on their starting board;
some Spirits have additional instructions. (Once the game begins, Spirits are not restricted to play
only on their starting board. Presence and Powers may be placed or used on any board.) Players
then flip their Spirit Panels and place all remaining Presence onto the dashed circles on their Presence
Tracks. The leftmost numbers with solid circles remain uncovered.
INVADERS' STARTING ACTION
To finalize the Setup, the Invaders take an initial Action. Reveal the top card of the Invader Deck.
The Invaders Explore in that land type (see Explore, page 10). Then place that card face-up in the
"Build" Action Space.

SEQUENCE OF PLAY
THE URGENCY OF WAR
Some Spirits are inclined to take a long time
choosing Power Cards: perhaps several centuries in
the case of slow-moving earth Spirits. But the threat
of the Invaders forbids the luxury of infinite time.
Any player may place a limit on the time available
to complete the Spirit Phase. This can be done using
a timer, setting a condition ("When I get back, we
start"), or any other means desired.
Of course, as this is a cooperative game, it behooves
you to not be too draconian.
WHO DECIDES?
When the game calls for a decision (where Blight
cascades to, which Invaders to do Damage to, etc)
1 and it's not specified who makes it, what do you do?
1
1
1
If the decision springs from a Power, the Spirit using
the Power makes the decision.
For other situations, players should try to come to a
consensus.
But in the rare event that agreement is not possible:
• For decisions about/within a land: Each Spirit
makes choices regarding the lands on their
starting board.
• For other cases: The game owner/organizer
makes the call.
Each turn has the following phases:
1. Spirit Phase
2. Fast Power Phase
3. Invader Phase
4. Slow Power Phase
5. Time Passes
Players play simultaneously within each phase, conferring as they wish. Table talk is not just allowed,
it's likely necessary for victory!
SPIRIT PHASE
Each Spirit does three things, in the following order:
1. Grow: Choose one option (unless stated otherwise) next to "Growth" at the upper-right of the
Spirit Panel. Each section is a single choice. You must do everything shown, but may choose the
order. (For more on Growth options, see page 14.)
2. Gain Energy: Gain an amount of Energy equal to the highest uncovered number on your
Energy Presence Track. Place any gained Energy on or near your Spirit Panel.
3. Play and Pay for Power Cards: Select the Power Cards (Fast and Slow) that you will use this
turn. The maximum number of Power Cards you can play each turn is the highest uncovered
number on the Card Plays Presence Track (even if you have enough Energy to pay for more).
You must immediately pay Energy for all Power Cards played, even Slow ones. Likewise, you
immediately gain all Elements from played Power Cards, even if the Powers' effects are Slow.
Do not resolve the effects of the Power Cards yet.
FAST POWER PHASE
Players resolve Fast Powers - both Innate Powers printed on their Spirit Panel and Power Cards they
played. Power resolution can be done mostly simultaneously. When timing becomes important,
Powers may be resolved in whatever order the players want, so long as no Power interrupts another
partway through.
If a player discovers they do not want to use a Power's text effect (or cannot use it), they may
choose to skip it entirely. Sometimes, a Power Card will be worth playing purely for its Elements (see
Elements Gained, p. 16).
You cannot delay using a Fast Power until the Slow Phase, even if you want to. Use it now or
forego it.

## Page 9
INVADER PHASE
The Invader phase has the following parts:
1. Blighted Island (once appropriate)
2. Fear
3. Invader Actions
3a. Ravage
3b. Build
3c. Explore
4. Advance Invader Cards
1. BLIGHTED ISLAND
If the Blight Card has flipped to "Blighted Island", follow the instructions there. If you have
trouble remembering to do this, put a Blight from the box onto the Fear Space as a reminder.
2. FEAR
If any Fear Cards have been earned (see Fear and Terror, page 12), pick up the whole face-
down stack, flip it over and resolve the cards one at a time in the order they were earned. Then
discard them to the Fear Discard Space on the board. Use only the effect listed next to the
current Terror Level. This could be higher than when the card was earned. Fear effects last only
for the current turn.
3. INVADER ACTIONS
The Invader Board has three Action Spaces: Ravage, Build, and Explore. The Invader Card in
an Action Space determines which lands will be affected by that Action. (If there is no Invader
Card in a space, no action is taken.)
3a. RAVAGE
Look at the Invader Card in the Ravage Action Space on the Invader Board (if any): the
Invaders Ravage in each land of the shown type only. First, Invaders deal Damage to the
land and Dahan. Then, any surviving Dahan fight back.
Wherever there are Invaders in the shown lands, Invaders deal Damage: 1 per Explorer, 2 per
Town, and 3 per City. Damage is done both to the land and Dahan.
1. Invaders Damage the Land: If 2 or more Damage is dealt, add a Blight to the land.
(See sidebar.) This only happens once, no matter how much Damage is dealt. Partial
Damage to the land is ignored.
2. Invaders Fight the Dahan: Every 2 points of Damage destroys one Dahan. You
must destroy Dahan as efficiently as possible; you cannot disperse Damage among
multiple Dahan to avaoid killing them. If a Dahan is dealt 1 Damage, turn it over to
show that it is Damaged. Any surviving Damaged Dahan will recover at the end of
the turn.
After Invader Damage has been fully resolved in a land, any surviving Dahan there fight
back. Each Dahan deals 2 Damage to the Invaders. (See page 15 for Invaders' Health.) The
Dahan will fight back even if the Ravaging Invaders deal no Damage (for example, due to
Defend Powers), but not if the Ravage Action has been skipped or stopped from happening
altogether.
Spirit Presence does not fight back as Invaders do not directly attack the Spirits.
FEAR EARNED THROUGH
FEAR EFFECTS
Most Fear effects do not cause more Fear.
They remove Invaders rather than Damaging
or destroying them. However, there are
exceptions. If you do earn a new Fear Card this
way, put it at the bottom of the stack of cards
you're currently resolving.
EFFECTS OF BLIGHT
CASCADING: Whenever you add Blight to a land,
if that land already has Blight, you must also add a
Blight to one adjacent land. (If that adjacent land
also already has Blight, it cascades again from there,
and so forth.)
PRESENCE: Adding Blight to a land destroys one
Presence from each Spirit in that land. Remember:
destroyed Presence is removed from play (set next to
the Island), not returned to the Spirit Panels!
(For more on Blight, see page 15.)
9

## Page 10
SEQUENCE OF PLAY
REMEMBER!
Ravage, Build, and Explore affect only the land
type(s) shown on their cards! Ravage and Build
Actions only affect lands that have Invaders! Explore
only affects lands adjacent to a source of Invaders!
STAGE II ESCALATION
Most Stage II cards have a flag icon.
Its effect depends on your Adversary.
If you are playing without an
Adversary, ignore the flag icons.
■ Escalation effects happen as soon
as the card is revealed, before
Explore, unless the Adversary states
otherwise. Some may make changes
to how the upcoming Explore works.
3b. BUILD
Look at the Invader Card in the Build Action Space on the Invader Board: the Invaders Build in
each land of the shown type only.
Wherever there are Invaders in the specified type of land, they add either one City or one Town:
• If the land has more Towns than Cities, add a City. (You are not upgrading the Towns, you
are adding a new City from the supply.)
• In all other cases, add a Town.
Do not Build in lands without Invaders.
3c. EXPLORE
Turn the top card of the Invader Deck face-up. Invaders Explore in accessible lands of the shown
type only, venturing forth from Towns and Cities or approaching from the Ocean. If the card
has a flag icon and you are playing with an Adversary, first perform the Escalation effect (see
sidebar). If there is no card to turn up, time has run out and you lose.
Add an Explorer to every land of the shown type which either:
• Contains a Town or City; or
• Is adjacent to a Town, City, or Ocean.
No matter how many sources are in or adjacent to an Explored land, you only add one Explorer.
Explorers are added directly from the supply, not moved around on the board.
4. ADVANCE INVADER CARDS
After Explore, slide all of the Invader Cards left: Move the Ravage Card to the discard, the Build
Card to the Ravage Space, and the Explore Card to the Build Space, so that next turn they will
Ravage where they Built this turn and Build where they Explored this turn.

SLOW POWER PHASE
EXPLORE
10
Players resolve Slow Powers, which may be either Innate Powers printed on their Spirit Panel or
Power Cards they played. This works just like the "Fast Power Phase", explained on page 8.
TIME PASSES
This is the wrap-up phase at the end of each turn.
Discard: Players discard all Power Cards played this turn into their personal discard piles.
Damage and Elements Clear: All Elements go away. All Damage done during the turn goes away; if
you turned any pieces on their sides to note partial Damage, turn them back.
If you're using the reminder tokens for Single-Turn Effects, make sure to remove those at this time.

For these examples, the Ravage Action takes place
in Wetlands because of the Invader Card shown.
A) This Wetland has 2 Dahan, 1 Town, and 1
Explorer in it. The Town and Explorer deal a
combined Damage total of 3 (2 from the Town
and 1 from the Explorer) to the land and to the
Dahan.
(Step 1) 3 Damage to the land adds a Blight.
3 Damage to the Dahan destroys one of the
Dahan and deals 1 Damage to the other.
(Step 2) Now it's the Dahan's turn to fight back,
dealing 2 Damage. The players choose to direct
that 2 Damage at the Town, destroying it. This
generates 1 Fear.
B) The City deals 3 Damage to the land; since
at least 2 Damage was dealt to the land, it adds
a Blight. Because Blight already exists here, the
newly added Blight causes a cascade: another
Blight must be added to an adjacent land of the
players choosing. Two of the available options are:
Option 1: The Blight cascades to land #2, which
was previously empty.
Option 2: The Blight cascades to land #7,
destroying I yellow Presence (meaning this land is
no longer a Sacred Site for yellow) and 1 purple
Presence (removing purple from the land entirely).
Option 1 is likely the better choice because it does
not destroy any Presence.
For these examples, the Build Action takes place in
Mountains because of the Invader Card shown.
A) This land has more Towns than Cities, so a City
is Built here.
B) This land has only Explorers, which means it
has the same number of Towns and Cities: zero.
Therefore, a Town is Built here.
C) This land has the same amount of Towns and
Cities, so a Town is Built here.
D) This land has no Invaders, so the Invaders do
not Build here.
For these examples, the Explore Action takes place in
Jungles because of the Invader Card shown.
A) This land includes a Town or City already, so an
Explorer is added here.
B) This land is not Coastal and is not adjacent to a
land with any Towns or Cities. The Invaders do not
Explore here.
C) This land is adjacent to a land with a Town or City,
so an Explorer is added here.
D) This land is Coastal and is adjacent to a land
with a Town or City. (Either would be sufficient.)
An Explorer is added here.

GAME CONCEPTS
TERROR LEVEL
০০০০
VICTORY AND DEFEAT
VICTORY CONDITION:
Terror Level Space on the Invader Board.
WIN CONDITIONS
Terror Level 1: No Invaders on the island.
At the start of the game, the Invaders are at Terror Level 1. They're not afraid of the island and
probably aren't even aware of the Spirits' existence. To win, you need to completely clear the island
of Invaders. As you earn Fear Cards (see Fear and Terror, below), you will reach new Terror Levels
with easier victory conditions. You win immediately anytime you meet the current victory condition.
You can lose three ways:
• Too Much Blight: If the last Blight comes off of the Blight Card, you follow the instructions there,
which are often "you lose".
• A Spirit Is Destroyed: If any Spirit has no Presence left on the island, you lose.
• Time Runs Out: If you need to draw an Invader Card (to Explore), but the Invader Deck is
empty, you lose.
FEAR AND TERROR
Fear is generated by Spirit Powers with the Fear symbol (1) and by destruction (either directly by
an effect or by Damage): destroying a Town generates 1 Fear and destroying a City generates 2
Fear. Fear terrifies the Invaders as a whole. For each Fear generated, advance one Fear Marker from
the Fear Pool on the Invader board to the Generated Fear area.
Terror Level 2: No Towns or Cities on the island.
2
FEAR
Terror Level 3: No Cities on the island.

VICTORY
Terror Level VICTORY: Immediate victory!
In the rare case that a single Power Card or other
effect causes you to both win and lose, you win a
sacrifice victory: you are destroyed, but the island,
the Dahan, and many other Spirits survive.

have advanced, (2) move the top
card of the Fear Deck face-down
into the Earned Fear Cards area. If
this reveals a Terror Level divider,
move it to cover the old Terror Level

Markers back to the Fear Pool; if
you have leftover Fear after earning
a card, move that many Fear
Markers to the Generated Fear area.
(4) Cards in the Earned Fear Cards
Space are flipped and resolved
during the next Invader Phase (see
page 9). Like Powers, effects of
Fear Cards last for the current turn
only, unless they change the board
in some way. After each Fear Card
is resolved, (5) move it to the Fear
Discard Space.
When you reveal a new Terror
Level divider, the new Terror Level
and victory conditions take effect
immediately, so you might instantly
win!

The game is played with one island board per player, laid out to make an island (see Setup,
page 6). Each island board is divided into eight numbered lands, with exactly two of each
terrain (Jungle, Mountain, Sands, and Wetland). Most pieces only affect other pieces in the
same land, unless explicitly specified.
Two lands are "adjacent" when they touch, even if they're not on the same island board or meet
only at a corner.
Each board also shows a swath of Ocean, to indicate which lands are readily accessible by sea.
Lands adjacent to the Ocean are Coastal. Lands not adjacent to the Ocean are Inland. (The
other island borders are rocky cliffs and do not count as Coastal.) The Ocean itself is not a land,
and is not in play.
The reverse side of each island board shows a thematic map that can be used to play once
you're more familiar with the game (see Thematic Map, page 23).
PRESENCE AND SACRED SITES
Spirit Presence marks the lands a Spirit occupies. Lands with your Presence are sometimes
referred to as "your lands". If your Presence is ever destroyed (for example, by Invaders Blighting
the land), it is removed and put next to the Island. If any Spirit ever has no Presence left on the
island, the players immediately lose. A land can hold any number of Presence from any number
of Spirits.
Game effects which do things with Presence (such as move it or destroy it) always affect
Presence on the Island unless they say otherwise.
A Spirit's Sacred Sites are any lands where that Spirit has more than one Presence. Some
Powers can only be used from these places of focused influence.

ENERGY AND CARD PLAYS
Spirits affect things on the island by playing Power Cards from their hand. A Spirit can play
whichever cards they like each turn, limited by two things:
• They can only play as many cards as they have Card Plays available, which is the highest
revealed number on the Card Plays Presence Track.
• They must have enough Energy to pay for the cards they play.
Every turn, each Spirit gains Energy equal to the highest revealed amount on their "Energy/
Turn" Presence Track. Unspent Energy carries over to the next turn. Energy is individual and
cannot be transferred between Spirits. Card Plays are also individual and cannot be shared with
other Spirits. Unused Card Plays do not carry over to future turns.

MOVING PRESENCE
It is rarely relevant, but whenever you would add
Presence, you may choose to instead move one
of your Presence already on the board. So, if you
manage to get all of your Presence into play,
you can still reposition it.
ELEMENTAL THRESHOLDS
Innate Powers have Elemental Thresholds,
meaning they can only be used on Turns you
have all the required Elements. Elements are
never spent, only checked.
Elements from Power Cards do not persist from
Turn to Turn. You have them only as long as the
Power Card is in play.
(See Elemental Thresholds, page 17)
1. Spirit Name
2. Art: An image of this Spirit.
3. Backstory: The story and history of the Spirit.
4. Setup: Initial Presence placement, and any special instructions.
5. Play Style/Complexity: A brief description of the Spirit's strategy and comparison of its
strengths and weaknesses, as well as a summary of Powers.
6. Special Rules: Any rules that work differently for this Spirit.
7. Growth Options: The Spirit's options for regathering of strength, reaching out to new lands, and
learning new Powers. When a Spirit chooses a Growth option, they will select one section and
take all of the actions indicated in it, unless specified otherwise. (See the sidebar for common
Growth options, and page 8 for the Growth step of the Spirit Phase.)
8. Presence Tracks: Each Spirit Panel contains two Presence Tracks. The top one is Energy Gained
per turn and the bottom one is Card Plays. To start, all but the leftmost space on each track is
covered by Presence. When placing Presence on the island, you can choose which track to take
it from, but always take it from left to right. As you remove Presence from each track you reveal
progressively greater benefits. Removing Presence from the top track grants you more Energy
each turn, while removing Presence from the bottom track allows you to play more Power
Cards each turn. Spirits use only the highest revealed number on the tracks for their Energy or
Card Plays (these benefits are not additive). Note: Destroyed Presence is removed from play,
not returned to the Panel!
• Some Spirits have a "Reclaim One" space. While this space is revealed, the Spirit may
return one Power Card to their hand any time during the Spirit Phase (so the ability can be
used the turn it is revealed), letting them go longer before having to take a "Reclaim All
Growth option.
• Some Spirits have bonus Elements on their Presence Tracks. These constantly provide one
of the shown Elements for as long as the space is revealed (see Elements Gained, page 16).
A space marked with "+Any" grants one Element each turn: the Spirit may choose which
Element they get at any time, but then cannot change it until the next turn.
9. Innate Powers: Free Powers that can be triggered using Elements. (For more on Powers, see
page 16). Unless explicitly specified, Innate Powers never cost Energy or use Card Plays. Like
all Powers, they target a single land or Spirit unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Page 15
INVADERS
The Invaders have begun to colonize your island! While not specifically aiming to exterminate
you, their colonization and "taming" of the land has upset the natural balance. The goal of the
game is to drive off the Invaders by meeting the victory conditions of the current Terror Level. As
more Invaders learn to Fear you, the victory conditions will get easier!
Invaders in a land do not automatically harm Spirit Presence or Dahan there. Invaders harm
things only when Ravaging (see Ravage, page 9). Each type of Invader has a specified Health.
To destroy an Invader, you must deal Damage that meets or exceeds its Health in one turn. Some
effects also destroy Invaders regardless of Damage or Health.
There are three types of Invaders: Explorers, Towns, and Cities. A land containing any number of
these is "a land with Invaders". The number of Invaders is not limited by the supply of pieces; in
the unlikely case that you run out, use 3-Energy tokens as "3 of this piece" markers.
Explorers represent Invaders willing to travel into uncharted wilderness: mapping
expeditions, the very boldest homesteaders, etc. They have 1 Health and deal 1 Damage
during Ravage.
Towns represent homesteads and small frontier settlements. They have 2 Health and
deal 2 Damage during Ravage. Towns act as a source of Explorers when Invaders
Explore.
Cities are the largest and most pernicious type of Invader piece. They have 3 Health
and deal 3 Damage during Ravage. Cities act as a source of Explorers when Invaders
Explore.
Destroying Towns and Cities affects the Invaders' morale. Whenever a Town is destroyed, it
generates 1 Fear. Whenever a City is destroyed, it generates 2 Fear (see Fear and Terror, page 12).
BLIGHT
Invaders slowly but inexorably Blight the land. A certain amount of Blight is normal in nature -
such as damage from a forest fire - but too much will overwhelm the island. When you add Blight
to the island during play, take it from the Blight Card - which starts Healthy side up or Blight
Space on the Invader board. If you remove Blight from the island, return it to the Blight Card. If
you run out of Blight on the card, follow its instructions - either "lose" or "flip the card over and do
what it says on the reverse". Flipped Blight Cards do not flip back; the island cannot heal from
Blighted to Healthy within the timespan of the game.
After Setup, whenever you add Blight to a land (including when Blight cascades), two bad things
happen:
1. Destroy Presence: In that land, destroy one Presence from each Spirit with Presence there.
Destroyed Presence is placed next to the island, not returned to the Spirit Panels.
2. Cascade: If the land already had any Blight, also add one Blight to any one adjacent land.
(If that adjacent land also has Blight, it will then cascade again from there, etc.)
(For an example Ravage Phase, see page 11.)
TRACKING DAMAGE
Town and City models are designed to help you track
how much Damage will destroy them.
This city has taken 1
Damage (2 more will
destroy it). It has been
laid on its side with 2
buildings facing up.
CITIES: 3 Health
Cities take 3 Damage
to destroy. You can
remember this by
counting the number of
individual buildings on
the model's base (3) as it
stands upright.
This city has taken
2 Damage (1 more will
destroy it). It has been
laid on its side with 1
building facing up.
TOWNS: 2 Health
Towns take 2 Damage
to destroy. The model
has 2 buildings to
remind you of this.
This town has taken 1
Damage (1 more will
destroy it). It has been
laid on its side.
When a piece has taken Damage equal to or
exceeding its Health, it is destroyed. Return it to the
supply, and earn 1 Fear for a Town or 2 Fear for a
City. At the end of each Turn, when Time Passes,
Damage clears and all models are reset.

OF MULTITUDES
THE DAHAN
The Dahan are the native human inhabitants of Spirit Island. They coexist well with the land and
the Spirits. They also aren't too thrilled about the Invaders' colonization, but are wary of initiating
violence.
Each island board starts with 6 Dahan pieces. Population growth in the game's timespan occurs only
with a few Powers which grant blessings of health, fertility, and good harvests. The number of Dahan
is not limited by the supply of pieces.
Dahan only attack Invaders when a Spirit Power prompts them to do so, or when attacked
themselves: after Invaders Ravage a land, any surviving Dahan in that land each deal 2 Damage
to the Invaders in that land.
Each Dahan has 2 Health, meaning they are destroyed by 2 Damage from Invaders. Damage from
Spirits does not hurt Dahan, although some Spirit Powers cause Dahan casualties as a terrible
side-effect.

POWERS
Spirits affect the game using Powers, which are either Power Cards or Innate Powers printed on a
Spirit Panel. Innate Powers function similarly to Power Cards, except they are automatically available
every turn (i.e. do not use Card Plays) and require having certain Elements rather than spending
Energy.
ANATOMY OF POWERS
1. Energy Cost (Power Cards only)
2. Name
3. Elements Gained (Power Cards only): There are eight Elements: Sun, Moon, Fire, Air, Water,
Earth, Plant, and Animal. When you play a Power Card, you gain the Elements shown. Some
Powers have extra effects if you have gained specific Elements (see #8 on the next page).
Elements do not carry over from turn to turn. You gain Elements the moment you pay for a Power
Card, regardless of whether the Power is Fast or Slow, and they go away as soon as it leaves play
(usually during Time Passes).
4. Speed: Fast Powers (3) resolve their effects before the Invader Phase, while Slow Powers
() resolve their effects afterwards. Power Cards also show their speed by a red or blue ring
around the Energy cost.
5. Range: How many lands away from your Presence this Power can reach. This is a maximum; you
can always use a shorter Range. A Range of O means a land where you have Presence. Some
Powers have limitations on what sort of land you can use them from (such as only from a Sacred
Site, or only from a specific terrain); these are shown left of the range icon.
6. Target: What land type this Power can affect. Most Powers can target any type of land, but some
are restricted by terrain, what's in the land, or whether it's Coastal/Inland. Powers always target
one single land unless explicitly stated. Some Powers target a Spirit instead of a land. (See back
cover for Targeting reference.)
7. Effects (Power Cards only): What the Power does. All effects take place in the single target land
unless explicitly stated otherwise. ("Destroy all means "Destroy all Towns in target land", not
"Destroy all Towns in the game!) Perform effects in order, skipping any that cannot be followed.
Effects that do not change anything on the board - such as "Invaders do not Build in target
land" - last only for the current turn.

## Page 17
8. Elemental Thresholds: Optional effects which may only be used if the Spirit has gained certain
Elements this turn (see #3 on the previous page). The required Elements are not "used up"; the
threshold is simply a check to see if they are in play. For instance, a Spirit with 2 Water in play
could meet any number of thresholds requiring 2 Water. You may always resolve a Power as
if you had fewer elements than you actually do. If you meet more than one threshold under a
Power, do each of them in order, from top to bottom.
• Exception: If a threshold says "Instead", it replaces the effects of previous levels.
GENERAL PRINCIPLE: DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
When resolving a Power's effects, do as much as you can. If one part does not apply or cannot be
done, skip it and do the rest. The only targeting restrictions are those in the target bar.
GENERAL PRINCIPLE: YOU CAN SKIP USING A POWER'S EFFECT
If you cannot or do not want to use a Power you've played - perhaps the board situation has
changed - you're allowed to skip its effects entirely, as if it had a blank text-box. If it was a Power
Card, you don't get your Energy back, but you do still get to use the Elements granted by the
card.
Similarly, when resolving a Power with thresholds, you may act as if you have fewer Elements
than you really do, to avoid hitting thresholds.
GENERAL PRINCIPLE: ONE LAND! ONE TURN! ONE USE!
Unless a Power explicitly says otherwise:
• It only affects one single target land. "Destroy up to 3 Explorers will let you destroy up to 3
Explorers in the same land - not in multiple different lands. If a Power has multiple effects,
they ALL apply to the same land.
• It only affects the current turn. "Dahan have +3 Health" or "Invaders do not Ravage in target
land" affect this turn only, not the rest of the game. Any permanent changes to the game
will be represented by changes to a board - pieces leaving, Fear Markers moving, etc.
• It can only be used once this turn. You cannot choose to pay for a Power Card twice and use
it twice. Innate Powers only trigger once even if you have twice as many Elements as you
need. If something makes a Slow Power Fast, you only get to use it during the Fast Phase,
not both.
SINGLE-TURN EFFECTS
A few Powers have temporary effects on a land (such as "Invaders skip all Actions"). There are
reminder tokens you can use to mark those lands for the turn if you want; just remember to
remove them at the end of the turn!
ELEMENTS
Sun: Day, light, heat, dominance, command,
constancy
1 Moon: Night, cycles, darkness, dreams,
transformation
Fire: Heat, anger, destruction, desire,
violent change
Air: Wind, sky, sound, distance, speed,
trickery, thought
Water: River, fluidity, fertility, empathy,
healing, disease
Earth: The land, strength, constancy,
stasis, resilience
Plant: Verdancy, growth, entwining,
regeneration
Animal: Beasts, humans, blood,
the body, life, death
DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
You do not have to be able to use every
part of a Power Card's effect to be
able to play it. For example, even if a
SPEED
Power Card reads:

1 Damage.

GAME CONCEPTS
WHAT POWER CARDS CAN I FORGET?
Any of your cards! From your hand, your discard,
or (if you somehow gain a Major Power mid-turn)
from your cards in play. It can even be the Major
Power you just chose. If you Forget a Power Card
from play, you immediately lose the Elements it
provided, and if you haven't used it yet, you don't
get to. If you already used it, its effects continue
until end of turn as usual.
DAMAGE HURTS INVADERS
Invaders are not the only recipients of Damage in
Spirit Island: the land and Dahan can take Damage
from Invaders Ravaging. But the overwhelming
majority of Damage in the game is done to Invaders.
Any time a Power, Fear Card,
or other game rule does Damage, it always means
"Damage to Invaders" unless explicity specified
otherwise. Most Spirit Powers do not harm the land
or Dahan.
DAMAGE TOKENS?
There are no tokens in Spirit Island for tracking
Damage. Instead the models are built to be rotated
to help track Damage done to them.
(For more details, see sidebars on page 15 and 16.)
GAINING POWER CARDS
You will usually gain new Power Cards via Growth, but some Power effects can grant them. New
Power Cards always go into your hand.
Whenever you're told to "Gain a Power Card":
• Choose whether you're gaining a Minor or Major Power. Draw 4 cards from that deck. If you
need to, reshuffle the deck's discard pile.
• Keep one drawn Power Card in your hand. Discard the others into the discard pile for that deck.
• After you gain a Major Power, you must Forget - permanently lose - one of your Power Cards.
Put the Forgotten Power Card into the discard pile for its deck, or out of the game if it is one of your Unique Powers.
If you are playing with a Power Progression, instead of drawing 4 and keeping one, simply take the
next card in your Progression. (See First-Time Players, page 3)
POWER AND FEAR EFFECTS
DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION, AND REMOVAL
Some effects remove Invaders, representing them fleeing in terror. Return the specified pieces to the
supply. Some replace Invaders: first you remove the Invader, then you put something else in its place.
A replaced Invader keeps any Damage it had. More Powers destroy Invaders outright. Return the
specified pieces to the supply. Destroying a Town generates I Fear and destroying a City generates 2
Fear, but removing or replacing does not.
Whenever a Power or other effect says "Damage", it always means "Damage to Invaders unless
explicitly specified otherwise. When dealing Damage, it is done to any Invaders in the target land,
divided among them however you choose. If an Invader has taken Damage equal to or greater than
its Health (see Invaders, page 15), it is destroyed immediately. Damage may be combined from
multiple Powers. However, at the end of the turn any remaining Damage on survivors.
DEFEND
Some Powers let you Defend a target land, which reduces Damage done by Invaders to the land
and/or Dahan. "Defend 2" means "Whenever the Invaders deal Damage to target land or Dahan
there this turn, reduce the total amount of Damage they do by 2". If multiple Defend effects are
used in one land, they add together. Defend effects last for the entire turn. There are optional tokens
you can use to help you remember that a land is Defended this turn.
FEAR FROM DESTRUCTION
Whenever you destroy a City or Town (via Damage or
otherwise), it frightens the Invaders. You generate
2 Fear for each City destroyed and 1 Fear for
each Town destroyed. If you remove or replace a
City/Town, it does not generate this automatic Fear.
REMOVING BLIGHT
DEFEND SIDE OF REMINDER TOKENS
When you remove Blight from the island, return it to the Blight Card, on whichever side is currently
face-up. The Blight Card will not flip from Blighted back to Healthy during the timespan of the
game, no matter how much Blight you remove.
18

## Page 19
GATHER AND PUSH
Some Powers tell you to Gather things into the target land (such as "Gather 1,
or "Gather up to 3). This means "Move that many things into the target land
from land(s) adjacent to it. Gather only pulls things in from adjacent lands; boosts
to a Power's Range do not affect Gathering distance.
Other Powers tell you to Push things from the target land (such as "Push 1",
or "Push up to 3"). This is the exact reverse of Gather. It means "Move that many
things out of the target land, to adjacent land(s)". Push only sends things one land
away; boosts to a Power's Range do not affect Pushing distance. If Pushing multiple
things, they may go to different lands or not, as you wish. You can only Push into a
valid land, not off the board or into the Ocean.
EXAMPLE OF GATHER AND PUSH
EXAMPLE CARD WITH
BOTH GATHER AND PUSH
1
CALL TO MIGRATE
GATHER
PUSH
Invaders are currently set up to Ravage in the
Sands next turn. The players want the nearby
Dahan to fight back against that City in land
#6.
REPEAT
Using the card 'Call to Migrate', the yellow
Spirit Gathers 2 Dahan from adjacent
lands into the target land #5.
Then, the Spirit uses the second half of the
card's effects to Push 3 Dahan fram target
land #5 into land #6. Now, when the City
Ravages, it will destroy one of the Dahan
and add a Blight, but the other two Dahan
will fight back and destroy the City.
Repeating a Power lets you activate its effects again. It does not give you Elements again (you
gain Elements for putting a Power Card in play, not for using its effect) and Repeats cannot be
chained (ignore any "Repeat" effects on a Repeated Power). The Repeated Power is Slow or Fast,
whichever the original Power is. Here are some additional fine points:
• Changes to a Power carry over to the Repeat use. (For instance, if a Power is made Fast or
given additional Range, that also applies to the Repeat.)
• You may make different choices when Repeating a Power.
• If a Repeat specifies where to use it, obey those instructions (instead of the usual Range and
Target restrictions). Otherwise, you can choose any valid target by the usual rules, including
the same target as its first use.
• Repeating a Power Card does not count as playing another Power Card. (For the purposes
of, e.g., Boon of Vigor.)

WHOOPS!
You suddenly realize that for the past 4 turns you've
been using a Power Card on lands it can't actually
target. What to do?
The answer is: don't sweat it.
Especially on your first play or two, you'll likely make
minor mistakes here and there. They're unlikely to
break anything: the game will just be slightly
easier/harder.
So long as everyone's having fun, it's all good, there's
no need to try and "rewind" and fix things. Just take
note of what the correct rule is, and use it going
forward!
STREAMLINING GAMEPLAY
• As you play Power Cards, put the required Energy on top of them. This will help you
remember to pay for them.
• When you resolve a Power Card, you can push it forward or turn it sideways to note
that it has been used. Don't discard it until end of turn, because you may be making
use of its Elements for Innate Powers!
• When you resolve a Fear effect that affects an Invader Action (such as "Defend 2 in all
lands"), place it atop the affected Invader Card so you don't forget to apply it.
• Every board has exactly two lands of each terrain. Knowing this can make it easier to
search out all lands of a particular terrain.
• When resolving Invader Actions, be clear about which player is handling what, so
you don't accidentally double Explore, Build, or Ravage. Some groups have each
player manage the Invader Actions on their starting board. This can help new players
understand how the Invaders act.
• During Setup, once you've put Blight on the Blight Card and the island, return the rest
of the Blight to the box. This prevents accidentally taking Blight from/returning Blight
to the wrong place! It's easy to access the box a single time when the island becomes
Blighted.
• When coordinating with your fellow Spirits, trying to remember every detail of what
every player is doing is a recipe for overload. It can be much more fruitful to focus on
objectives, diving into details only when necessary.
• Some players enjoy the game with a very analytical and carefully planned style, while
others prefer very fast-and-loose "good enough!" play. The game works either way (or
anywhere between) but both extremes at the same table can cause frustration. Try to
make sure everyone is on the same page regarding time taken. (See The Urgency of
War, page 8).

BASIC STRATEGY
Feel under no obligation to read or use these refer to them if you're feeling lost in you first
games.
FIGHTING THE INVADERS
• Destroy or move Explorers before they Build to keep Invaders from spreading.
• Destroy Invaders before they Ravage to keep them from harming the land and the Dahan.
• Once Invaders Explore into a particular terrain, you know they'll Build there next turn, and
Ravage there the turn after that. That predictability is useful when planning how to use Slow
Powers.
WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY PRESENCE/SACRED SITES?
• Put your Presence close enough to the Invaders that you can use all your Powers on them.
• Avoid lands where Invaders are about to Ravage and add Blight. It will destroy your Presence.
• Spread your Presence out across the island so you can collaborate with other players. Three "l
Damage Powers can destroy a City!
• Many Damaging Powers and beneficial Fear effects require Sacred Sites, so put them close
to the Invaders.
WHERE SHOULD I MOVE THE DAHAN?
• Into lands with a few Invaders. Many Fear effects will scare off Invaders from lands with
Dahan, or inspire the Dahan to take the offensive. If Invaders are about to Ravage there,
surviving Dahan will fight back.
• Out of lands with many Invaders. If the Dahan will be wiped out when the Invaders Ravage,
save them by getting them out of harm's way!
MISCELLANEOUS
• Blight spreads quickly once it starts cascading. Try to clean up lands before a second Blight is
added.
• If you are having trouble finding good targets for your Powers, that can mean one of two
things:
1. That you are winning! If you have the Invaders on the ropes, focus on achieving victory!
2. That your Presence/Sacred Sites aren't close to the parts of the board you want to affect.
Focus on getting Presence and Sacred Sites in places where your Powers will be able to
reach the Invaders.
• If you are feeling constantly low on Energy, try placing more Presence from your Energy
Track, not using all of your Power Card plays, choosing less expensive Power Cards, or taking
an Energy-granting Growth option for a turn or two.
• Major Powers require a lot of Energy to play, and require Forgetting one of your existing
Power Cards when you gain them. You will usually want to take Minor Powers for your first
pick or two.

SOLO PLAYER MODE
Solo games work much like normal games, but with a single board as the whole island. The only
difference is that you can target yourself with Powers that specifically target "Another Spirit", though
you do not gain extra benefits from Powers that are better when used on another Spirit, like Gift of
Constancy or Elemental Boon. Also, the luck of the draw is high, and you have no fellow Spirits to
compensate for your Spirit's weaknesses and limitations.
ADVERSARIES
Adversaries are specific colonizing Powers from the world of Spirit Island. Including an Adversary in a
game is optional, but doing so adds an additional layer of depth and strategy to the game. Be sure
to choose your foe before Setup begins, as some may change the rules of Setup.
is revealed on
The Adversary Panel specifies an Escalation effect, which is performed when the
Stage II Invader Cards (see page 10). Some Adversaries also include additional loss conditions.
These two rules are the base level of an Adversary, providing a small difficulty boost. From there,
each Adversary offers multiple increased difficulty levels, indicated by the number on the left. All
listed game effects are cumulative: if you're fighting vs. Level 3, you also use the effects from Level
1 and Level 2. Some Adversaries modify the Invader Actions. There are Reminder Tiles to put below
the Invader Action spaces on the Invader Board to remind you that the rules for those Actions are
modified. For a full list of each Adversary's difficulty rating, see the chart on page 28.
FEAR CARDS
As the difficulty increases, reaching higher Terror Levels becomes harder. Each Level shows how
many Fear Cards to use and how many cards go in the top/middle/bottom of the Fear Deck.
THE KINGDOM OF BRANDENBURG-PRUSSIA
• Excellent first adversary with few new rules; most of the changes occur during game Setup.
• Speed is the name of the game: the Invaders do everything at a faster tempo. Cards with 2
land types come up much earlier, often before the Spirits have had time to prepare.
• This Adversary is notably harder for Spirits which need substantial time to develop.
THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND
• Buildings, buildings, and more buildings - England sends so many immigrants that the colonies
spill over into unexplored lands. It doesn't start out fast, but constantly pushes its borders
forward. They will push hard to found a capital during Stage II.
• England is notably easier for Spirits good at wrecking Towns (e.g. Lightning's Swift Strike).
• This Adversary is notably harder for Spirits which rely on moving/killing Explorers to prevent
Invader Builds (e.g. Shadows Flicker Like Flame).
THE KINGDOM OF SWEDEN
• Sweden's Ravages are more dangerous than most, with advanced military tactics and a large
population interested in farming and mining. The Crown's policies favor assimilating the Dahan
where possible, though these efforts will only work where Invader population is large.
• This Adversary is notably easier for Spirits which can prevent Ravages (e.g. A Spread of
Rampant Green or Vital Strength of the Earth).
• A Note Regarding Setup: The Kingdom of Sweden can add Blight during Setup. Blight added
during Setup does not cascade or destroy Spirit Presence.

SCENARIOS
Scenarios change the situation the Spirits find themselves in, or the capabilities of the Spirits.
They may involve different victory conditions or additional prerequisites for the standard victory
condition, in addition to other rules changes. All Scenarios have a number in the upper-right
corner that denotes their difficulty rating on a scale from O (no change) - 10 (insanely difficult).
Playing with Scenarios is optional. You may play a game with an Adversary and a Scenario or
just using one or the other. If rules changes from a Scenario and an Adversary contradict each
other, the Scenario takes precedence.
SCENARIO
BLITZ
THEMATIC MAP
The reverse side of each island board shows an alternate map. These maps represent the
canonical Spirit Island, and prioritize theme more highly than the front "balanced" sides: land
types cluster together, wet terrains tend to be on the windward side of mountains, etc.
The thematic boards are intended for experienced players, both because finding terrains at a
glance is harder with the more realistic art style, and because some of the changes make the
game more difficult: more lands per board, clustered terrains, more starting Invaders, etc.
THEMATIC BOARD SETUP
The thematic boards have a fixed layout relative to each other. You can use any of them that
you want - but for the definitive geography at each player count:
• 1 player: Use Northeast.
• 2 players: Use West and East, touching on the side opposite the Ocean.
• 3 players: Use West and East as above, plus Northeast above East.
• 4 players: Use West, East, Northwest, and Northeast in the usual four player layout.
Some lands overlap slightly onto other boards. A land is always considered to be on the board
where its land number and Setup icons are. Ignore any unattached land fragments; they aren't
in play.
Some lands have Setup icons for tokens from the Branch & Claw expansion; ignore them when
playing with just the core game. Illustrations of Spirits, rivers, and wildfires are for flavor and do
not alter gameplay.
SCORING
If you would like to score your games (to compare your group's performance across game
plays):
• Victory: Score 5x Difficulty, +10 bonus for winning, +2 per Invader Card remaining in the
deck.
• Defeat: Score 2x Difficulty, +1 per Invader Card not in the deck (both in the discard and
face-up under Invader Actions).
• Victory or Defeat: +1 per X living Dahan and -1 per X Blight on the island, where X is the
number of players in the game.

LORE
THE STORY THUS FAR
The world of Spirit Island is roughly similar to our own world's past. Details
differ, but the overall trends of society and technology across the globe are
broadly the same.
Europe is no exception: its politics have taken a different turn, but the
customs and attitudes of its people are similar to our own history. There is
some belief in the supernatural - religion speaks of good and evil powers,
there are folk customs and superstitions - but nowhere in Europe or other
large empires of humanity is there a place where the stones will speak to
you or trees draw up their roots and rove across the land.
It is no wonder the Invaders fail to understand Spirit Island when they
arrive.
THE ISLAND
The Island has existed far longer than humans have lived there. But despite
the continued existence of first-hand witnesses, assembling a coherent
history is virtually impossible. Even among the most trustworthy Spirits,
tales of the past are rife with contradictions, all maintained to be true. Did
Voice of the Deepest Gorge sacrifice itself, or descend to some greater
destiny, or remain unchanged as an oracle of sorts? All three, apparently.
Estimations of time and ordering are similarly hazy.
THE SPIRITS
The Spirits of the Island are many and diverse: thronging wisps of breeze,
strange half-seen shadows across still water, the sunbeam which forms
perfect patterns even through tangled deadwood. Most do not fight the
Invaders: the smaller Spirits are too weak; the greatest ones too slow or
so strong they'd destroy the Island. Some, like Watcher Acts Not, are
restrained by their own nature; and others can't be bothered. Not every
grove or gully has a Spirit - but there are certainly more Spirits than
Dahan.
THE DAHAN
The Dahan were the first humans on Spirit Island. They immigrated
centuries ago, in a time when Ocean's Hungry Grasp prowled nearby
waters less frequently. Their lore spoke of Spirits, and they expected their
new home would have some, but were greatly surprised by the Spirits'
numbers, vitality, and intensity of manifestation. Some mistook the greater
Spirits for gods.
24
The Dahan's agriculture and animals brought Blight to the land and
conflict with the Spirits, triggering the First Reckoning. The Dahan
capitulated quickly, and an accord was reached: the Spirits would
transform crops and animals to be more compatible with the ecosystem.
The Dahan would change their methods of farming and seek counsel from
friendlier Spirits. The two became neighbors, though unequal: the Dahan
were reliant on and obligated to the Spirits.
THE SECOND RECKONING
Many generations later came the Second Reckoning, when the Dahan
discovered their advisors and protectors had not been entirely candid with
them, and the power balance between Dahan and Spirits evened out - but
that is another story. Suffice it to say that the Dahan no longer view the
Spirits as gods.
THE INVADERS
The Invaders found Spirit Island a decade ago. Early coastal contact
with the Dahan was fairly peaceful. The Dahan saw these new seafarers
as analogues of their those-who-travel, and offered them appropriate
hospitality. The Invaders saw a fertile, sparsely-populated island, and
brought word home of a land ripe for the taking.
The first colony ships arrived five years later, bringing both settlers and
an onslaught of foreign diseases which tore through the Dahan. Spirit
assistance helped many Dahan survive - but even so, as the game opens,
they are just regaining their footing, mourning their dead, and discovering
that these scourges were not the act of angry Spirits. They are divided
on what to do: some see the Invaders as a menace to drive away, while
others still think of them as "our new neighbors", or are fascinated with their
lifestyle, tools, and beliefs.
The larger Spirits of the Island live and act on much longer timescales than
humans. The most common reaction to the Invaders' arrival was "oh, great,
more humans - here we go again", tempered with some optimism that
Spirit-speakers of the Dahan could act as intermediaries to avoid another
confrontation.
But the Invaders refused to listen, and spread impossibly quickly, with
more and more colony ships arriving each year. In the blink of an eye there
were nearly as many Invaders as Dahan, methodically reshaping the land,
destroying Spirit and Dahan alike in their heedless, swarming expansion...
YOU ARE THE SPIRITS.
CAN YOU SAVE YOUR ISLAND?

Though the Adversaries may seem familar, upon closer inspection you will
find that the Explorers of Spirit Island have a slighly different story to tell
than your history books. The year is A.D. 1700, and the Great Powers of
Europe have begun a scramble for colonies throughout the world. In the
alternate history setting of Spirit Island, this scramble is even more intense
than in our own world, as historical events have transpired to lead to the
rise of many major naval powers.
THE KINGDOM OF BRANDENBURG-PRUSSIA:
FREDERICK II
THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND
Queen Elizabeth I of England married Robert Dudley, son of the Duke
of Northumberland, in 1562. The marriage was initially a scandal due to
the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Dudley's first wife,
and inspired a revolt of several noble houses. However, the co-monarchs
Robert I and Elizabeth I grew in popularity after the suppression of the
revolt in 1564 and the birth of their son Edward in 1566. With the defeat of
an attempted invasion from Spain and Scotland in 1587, the Kingdom of
England became one of the premier naval powers in the North Atlantic.
After the death of Robert in 1588 and Elizabeth in 1603, their son Edward
VII became King of England.
England was only briefly involved in the religious wars on the continent in
the 17th century. Following a disastrous invasion attempt in France in 1633
and a clash with Scotland in 1651, the Kingdom of England focused on
fortifying the Scottish frontier and building up its naval power.
Unable to project power on the continent and constrained to southern
Britain, the Kingdom of England was one of the first to seek colonies in
the New World, using its overseas possessions to provide citizens with
opportunities that were increasingly hard to come by at home.
KINGDOM OF SWEDEN: KING ERIK XV
Following his triumph at the Battle of Lützen in 1632, King Gustavus
Adolphus led the Kingdom of Sweden to further victories over Catholic
armies, defeating and partitioning the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
with Brandenburg and Russia in 1644. Following his death in 1651, Gustavus
Adolphus was succeeded by his son, King Gustav III, who went on to defeat
Kingdom of Denmark in a series of campaigns between 1657 and 1668 and
secure total Swedish dominion over the Baltic Sea.
Frederick William inherited the Duchy of Prussia and Electorate of
Brandenburg upon the death of his father George William in December
1640. Eschewing the ineffective and vacillatory foreign policy of his father,
Frederick William abandoned the Polish Vasa dynasty and allied with
King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden against Catholic Poland. The triple
Gustav III was succeeded by his son Erik in 1683, who became the eighth
alliance of Sweden, Russia, and Brandenburg-Prussia resulted in the
resounding defeat of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1644, and its Vasa ruler of Sweden. Under his rule, constrained from further growth on
subsequent partition more than doubled the size of Prussian lands.
As a result of this victory, Frederick William, the Great Elector of
Brandenburg, declared himself Frederick I, King in Prussia, and set about
the process of building infrastructure and extending Prussian control
throughout his newly acquired territory. Upon his death in 1701, his son
Frederick II inherited a thoroughly Prussian kingdom and one of the
premier European armies.
Frederick II sought to further expand Prussian territory without upsetting
the continental balance of power between Sweden, Russia, France, and the
Habsburgs. Building up the Prussian navy, the new king strove to catch up
to other European colonial powers and quickly integrate new colonies into
1 the Prussian economy.
26
the continent by Russia to their East and the Holy Roman Empire and
Prussia to their south, Sweden begun leveraging its powerful navy to set
up colonies throughout the world.
The absorption of former Polish lands in the eastern Baltic has given
Sweden a significant influx of Slavs and other non-Scandanavian
people. While a tremendous boon to their economic and military power,
this demographic shift has also been a source of internal turmoil as the
Kingdom of Sweden attempts the historically difficult task of integrating
a multi-ethnic society. Along with a desire for more natural resources,
Sweden's desire for a "safety valve" outlet for discontents and political
agitators has driven their desire to establish themselves as a colonial power.

DESIGN NOTES
The seed for Spirit Island was prompted by a colonization action in some other game - Goa? Navegador? Endeavor? - where I thought, "I
wonder how angry the locals are about this new colony of foreigners? We'll never know, because this game has entirely abstracted away the
people who already lived there. Well, that's kind of rude." I shared the thought, maybe people laughed, then we got back to the game.
The idea stuck with me, though, because so many Euros have themes from that era: some explicitly colonial, others social or mercantile. It
seemed like a game portraying the opposite point of view - that of being the subject of colonialism, trying to fight it off - could be interesting,
and perhaps highlight the prevalence of eurocentric colonial themes.
In retrospect, I could have gone an entirely different route: find a specific colonial-vs-anticolonial struggle to try and model, going down a
path similar to, e.g., King of Siam. Instead, my brain imagined a conflict that never was, but which could serve as a stand-in for struggles
against different colonial powers throughout history. Spirit Island poses the question: what if actual (or semi-actual) colonizers from the Age of
Discovery tried to colonize a place where they faced opposition of a nature they never expected?
(There is, incidentally, a reason that Spirits exist in abundance on Spirit Island, but are unknown to most empires of humanity. It goes back
millennia, and has to do with binding bargains.)
I set as my design goal a cooperative game as thematically evocative as strong 'experience' games like Arkham Horror, but with substantially
deeper and more strategic gameplay, a playtime of roughly two hours, and no 'alpha player'/'quarterbacking' problem that some groups
have with co-ops. It's been a long road, but I'm pleased with how it's turned out and I hope you have even more fun playing it than I've had
creating it.
