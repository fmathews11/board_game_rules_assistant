If you have the choice of more than one Defensive
Ability, choose one before rolling your dice.
The Defensive Ability is not activated if the

collateral, or is the result of an opponent's Ultimate
Ability (see "Damage Types" on page 10).
DEFENSIVE DICE

ULTIMATE kind may be performed by any opponent until the ability fully completes.
ULTIMATE ABILITY F
Your hero's most powerful attack! If activated,
the effects are completely unstoppable.
IMPORTANT: The damage and effects of an Ultimate Ability can be enhanced, but cannot be reduced,
prevented, avoided, responded to, or interrupted by anything (e.g. cards, Status Effects, Companions,
etc). Opponents may take no action of any kind from the time it is Activated until the conclusion of the Roll
Phase. The only way to prevent an Ultimate Ability is to alter a die roll before its activation.

STATUS EFFECTS
Each hero has a unique set of Status Effects A,
represented by tokens. If you need more tokens than
are provided, represent them with something else.
Positive or Negative Status Effects can be gained or inflicted
on yourself or other players. Status Effects are usually gained or
inflicted through cards or Offensive Abilities.
When you gain or inflict a Status Effect, take the corresponding
token from your Hero Leaflet and place it in the middle of the
receiving player's Hero Board F. This Status Effect is now
considered to be "in play". If a player is defeated, Status Effects
they inflicted on other players remain in play.

REMOVING STATUS EFFECTS
When a Status Effect is removed, return the token to the
appropriate space on its Hero's Leaflet. When using cards or
abilities that remove a specific number of Status Effects, remove
that many tokens.
SPENDABLE STATUS EFFECTS
Some Status Effects are removed when you spend them. Unless
otherwise specified, you may spend these status effects at any
time during any phase of any player's turn and their effects are
immediate.
PERSISTENT STATUS EFFECTS
A Status Effect marked as "Persistent" remains in
play until the end of the game, or until a card or
ability causes its removal.
STACK LIMITS
Many Status Effects can be applied multiple times to a hero,
creating a stack of them. The Stack Limit represents the
maximum number of tokens of a particular Status Effect that
can be on a single Hero Board at a given time (e.g. a Status Effect
with a Stack Limit of 2 can have a maximum of 2 tokens on each
Player).
Example (left): Cursed Pirate has inflicted a
Powder Keg Fand two Wither H Status Effects on
the Gunslinger. Wither is marked as Persistent in the
Status Effect description, so it will remain on the
Gunslinger's Hero Board until the Gunslinger is able to
remove it. Wither has a Stack Limit of 2G, allowing
the Cursed Pirate to inflict it twice on the Gunslinger.
INCREASING STACK LIMIT
If a player increases the Stack Limit of a Status Effect, the
increase only applies to that player, and lasts for the duration of
the game.
UNIQUE STATUS EFFECTS
These fundamentally break the standard Status
Effect rules (explained in their description).
Unique Status Effects often have a custom shape
and/or size 1.
INTERRUPTING STATUS EFFECTS
If a Status Effect is spent, its effects cannot be interrupted.
COMPANIONS
Some heroes have Companions, which are
represented by tokens, dials, or other
custom components. Companions are not
Status Effects, and are therefore immune
to cards and abilities that alter Status
Effects (e.g.).
Companions feature custom rules on the
Hero Leaflet A. They cannot be removed,
transferred, or destroyed, unless otherwise
specified in the Companion's ruleset.

HERO CARDS
There are two types of cards: Hero Upgrade cards and Action
cards.
During your Income Phase, you draw a card from your deck. If
you need to draw a card, but your deck is empty, shuffle your
Discard Pile to create a new deck first.
Playing cards costs Combat Points (CP). This cost is indicated on
the left hand side of the card. Cards costing 0 CP are free to play.
You must conclude your Discard Phase with no more than 6
cards in your hand. If you reach the Discard Phase with more
than 6 cards, you must sell cards until you have 6 or fewer. To
sell a card, discard it and increase your CP Dial by 1 (all cards are
worth 1 CP when sold, no matter how much it costs to play).
The phase during which a card may be played is indicated by the

DAMAGE TYPES
The current amount of damage waiting to be dealt to a player is
considered "incoming damage".
There are 5 damage types: normal (denoted as simply "dmg"),
undefendable, pure, collateral, and ultimate.
DAMAGE TYPE ATTRIBUTES
Each damage type has one or more of the following attributes:
Defendable - If the damage is the result of your opponent's
Offensive Ability, you may perform your Defensive Ability.
Avoidable - Can be reduced, prevented, avoided, or
interrupted by cards and/or Status Effects.
Enhanceable - Can be improved with Attack Modifiers.
Special Targeting Rules - The player to receive the damage is
specified in the description. No Targeting Phase is necessary to
determine who will receive this damage.
NORMAL DAMAGE
This is the most common type of damage, denoted by a black
circle with a number in it (e.g. 5) followed by "dmg".
Defendable, Avoidable, and Enhanceable.
No Special Targeting Rules
UNDEFENDABLE DAMAGE
Another common type of damage denoted by a red circle with
a number in it (e.g. 2) followed by "undefendable dmg”.
Not Defendable, but it is Avoidable (with cards / Status Effects).
Enhanceable.
No Special Targeting Rules.
PURE DAMAGE
• A special type of undefendable damage denoted by a red circle
with a number in it (e.g. 2) followed by “pure dmg”.
Not Defendable, but it is Avoidable.
• Not Enhanceable.
No Special Targeting Rules.
COLLATERAL DAMAGE
A special type of undefendable damage denoted by a red circle
with a number in it (e.g. 2) followed by "collateral dmg”.
Not Defendable, but it is Avoidable.
Not Enhanceable.
Has Special Targeting Rules (specified on the ability/card).
Does not qualify as an "Attack" since it does not directly target.
When dealt to multiple players of the same team at the same
time, reduce the Health Dial by the combined total dealt.
ULTIMATE DAMAGE
A special type of undefendable damage dealt by your
Ultimate Ability A
Denoted by a red circle with a number in it (e.g. 2).
Not Defendable or Avoidable.

ULTIMATE Rice may be altered to prevent an Ultimate. Otherwise, no action of
kind may be performed by any opponent until the ability fully completes.
Gunslinger's Ultimate Ability
ATTACK MODIFIERS
Any card or Status Effect that modifies an Attack is
considered an "Attack Modifier."
They can be played before or after the Defensive Ability is
activated.
Damage added by Attack Modifiers is considered to be of the
same damage type as the original damage being dealt.
Attack Modifiers can only be used on Attacks (i.e. an
Offensive Ability that targets an opponent with at least
1 dmg).

4 PLAYER GAMES
2v2 TEAM GAME
When playing with 4 players, apply the following rule changes:
The game is played in teams of two.
Teammates sit next to each other
1
3
and are encouraged to view each
other's hands & strategize.
Roll to determine the Start Player.
Turn order alternates between
teams in a zigzag pattern.
2
4
Teammates share one Health Dial
beginning with 50 health.
The Start Player skips the Income Phase of their first turn.
When one teammate receives damage, reduce the shared
Health Dial by the corresponding amount. If both teammates
take damage at the same time, reduce the Health Dial by the
combined total of damage taken by both teammates.
Teammates still have their own individual CP Dials. A player's
CP may only be spent on their own cards and abilities.
Players cannot intervene to reduce their teammate's
incoming damage unless specified by a card/status effect
(e.g. the card 'Not This Time!' can be played on teammates
because it refers to "A chosen player").
Players may alter dice to prevent a teammate from taking
damage in the first place or to improve their dice outcome.
3 PLAYER GAMES
KING OF THE HILL
When playing with 3 players, apply the following rule changes:
• Each player begins the game with 35 Health.
Roll to determine the Start Player.
• Players take turns in a clockwise order.
• When Attacking, you may target any player desired. However,
you receive a bonus card if you choose to Attack the Leader.
• The player(s) with the most Health remaining are considered
the Leader(s).
• If you target a Leader with an Attack, you draw 1 card
from your deck. The card draw happens immediately after
choosing your target (before any other effects occur).
If you Attack an opponent who is tied with you for the lead,
(e.g. you and another player both have 30 Health), you still
draw 1 bonus card.
• If you are the only Leader (i.e. you alone have the most
Health), you cannot earn a bonus card.
OTHER MODES
Dice Throne can be played in both King Of The Hill and Team
Game modes with up to 6 players. We strongly recommend that
your group does not attempt this until everyone is very familiar
with the game. 5-6 player games are fun and intense for
seasoned players, but will drag on if attempted by new players.

knowledge of how Dice Throne works to try
out a 1v1 game. We recommend you return to
this reference section when you have a question.
The following is a detailed breakdown of each phase of a turn.
1. UPKEEP PHASE
Determine if any of your Status Effects or
Place 1 card from your hand onto your Discard Pile.
Increase your CP Dial by 1 (all cards are worth 1 CP
when sold, no matter how much it costs to play).
B Play Main Phase Action cards

abilities activate during your Upkeep Phase.
Then resolve these effects (note: this will not be
applicable for most heroes during the
beginning of the game).
2 If there are multiple effects, the Active Player may
3
choose the order in which they are resolved.
*
All damage and/or healing effects are accumulated and
are applied simultaneously at the conclusion of the
phase.
2. INCOME PHASE
Important: The Start Player skips the Income Phase of their
first turn.
• Reduce your CP Dial by the CP
cost shown on the left side of
the card.
Perform the described action(s).
Place the card onto your Discard
Pile.
C Play Hero Upgrade cards

side of the card.

maximum of 15 CP).
Draw 1 card from the top of your deck and add it to your
2
hand. If your deck is empty, shuffle your Discard Pile to
create a new deck.
12
3. MAIN PHASE (1) M
4. OFFENSIVE ROLL PHASE
1
Perform any of the options below in any order, and as many
times as you like:
During this phase, any player may choose to play
Roll Phase Action cards after any step listed below.
A
A Sell any card
1 Perform up to 3 dice rolls:
Roll all 5 of your dice.
Optional: reroll any number of dice.
Optional: for a second time, reroll any number of dice.
2 When you are satisfied with your roll, you may
either:
Announce the Offensive Ability that you intend
to Activate (your Final Dice Result must meet its
Activation Requirement).
Announce that you are not going to Activate an
Offensive Ability at all.
• Tip: Activating a weak Attack against an opponent
with a powerful Defensive Ability is not always
advisable.
3 If you, a teammate, or an opponent have altered
any of your dice at this point (e.g. someone
played 'Twice As Wild'), you may either:
Announce a different Offensive Ability based on the
new Final Dice Results.
Return to step of the Offensive Roll Phase and use
any remaining unused rerolls.
4 Activate the Offensive Ability (if one was chosen):
Determine its variable effects (some abilities require
additional steps to determine their full effects).
Resolve any effects that do not require a target (e.g.
gain Evasive, gain Back Strike, Heal 5, etc).
5. TARGETING ROLL PHASE
If you have more than one opponent, you must determine your
target.
Note: Targeting an opponent still
applies even if you have activated
6. DEFENSIVE ROLL PHASE
1
If the Active Player's Offensive Roll Phase results in an
Attack, then the Defender now begins the Defensive
Roll Phase.
MARK THE TARGET
1
an ability that does no damage,
but has effects that must be
reconciled (e.g. 'Mark the Target'
inflicts Bounty 3).
Gain 2 Evasive.
Inflict Bounty.
In King of the Hill variants, simply choose an opponent to Attack
(see "King of the Hill" on page 11).
To decide who the Defender will be in 2v2 games:
1 Roll 1 die.
This die may be manipulated with cards, unless 1
the Attack is an Ultimate Ability. Dice could have
been manipulated before an Ultimate Ability
Activated, but as this is now the Targeting Roll
Phase, the Ultimate Ability has already Activated and
simply requires a target.
2
3
Resolve any effects from the Offensive Ability
that require a target and are not Damage related
(e.g. inflict Status Effects such as Wither or Bounty,
Steal CP, etc).
If the Offensive Ability results in an Attack and if that
Attack's damage type is defendable, the Defender may
activate their Defensive Ability.
Note: Most heroes only have 1 Defensive Ability.
However, if a hero has 2, they must choose one now.
Defender rolls the indicated number of dice (e.g.
DEFENSE ROLL 1 means roll 1 die).
4 Based on the dice results, the Defender resolves all
non-damage effects (e.g. gain Synth, inflict Shame
gain CP, etc).
2
Determine the Defender who will be receiving the
damage based on the result of your die roll:
5
There is one last opportunity for any player to spend
Status Effects or play cards.
1 or 2 - Target the opponent on your left.
3 or 4 - Target the opponent on your right.
5 - Your opponents choose which of them you target.
6 - Choose either opponent as your target.
Note: For targeting rules on other variants, visit:
http://variants.dicethrone.com
6
Finally, all damage, prevention, and/or healing effects are
accumulated and are applied simultaneously at the
conclusion of the Roll Phase.
• Note: If all remaining players are simultaneously
reduced to O health, the game is a draw.
7. MAIN PHASE (2) M
Identical to Main Phase (1).
8. DISCARD PHASE
1
2
3
Sell cards from your hand, until you have 6
or fewer cards.
Increase your CP Dial by 1 for each card sold
(more expensive cards are not worth more
CP).
Place any sold cards onto your Discard Pile.

OTHER RULES
REDUCING DAMAGE
Effects that reduce damage apply to the cumulative total of
damage dealt during the phase in which they are played.
Example: You have dealt dmg to your opponent. Their
Defensive Ability prevented 2 of the incoming damage.
You then play a card that adds
dmg. The total amount
prevented would be 6.
TIMING CONFLICTS AND INTERRUPTING
Occasionally, players will want to perform actions at the
same time. If this happens, resolve the actions in clockwise
order, beginning with the Active Player. Any player can, also
in clockwise order, interrupt this regular flow of play with
Instant Action cards, Roll Phase Action cards, or Spendable
Status Effects. After all interruptions are complete, the
previous order of play continues normally.
Example: The Gunslinger defends an
Attack with her 'Duel' Defensive Ability.
then interrupts her Defensive Ability
DUEL II
DEFENSE ROLL 1
You and your Attacker
She rolls a 1 and loses the "duel." She
each roll 1:
If your roll is equal or greater,
by playing a 'So Wild' card to change
her die to a 6. Play then continues
normally and she is now winning the
"duel" as a result of her interruption.
you may choose to either
deal 3 dmg or prevent 15 dmg
rounded up
If your roll is less, deal 1 dmg.

targets an opponent (i.e. not collateral dmg).
Attack Modifier: A Status Effect or card that increases the
damage or adds an effect to an Attack.
Collateral Damage: Damage that does not have a target
and therefore does not qualify as an Attack. Not defendable,
but it is avoidable. Cannot be enhanced.
Combat Points (CP): Spent to play cards and activate
abilities from your Hero Board. Players can have a maximum
of 15 CP. Players Gain 1 CP at the start of their turn (except
the Start Player's first turn).
Companion: Reference your Hero Leaflet for their unique
definition (see “Companions” on page 7).
Defender: The player who is being targeted by an Attack.
Final Dice Result: The result of your five dice after all rerolls
and dice modification are finished.
Gain: For Status Effects, take the corresponding token and
place it on the middle of your Hero Board. For Health or CP,
increase your Health or CP Dial by the specified amount.
Heal: Increase your Health Dial by the specified amount. You
may heal up to 10 Health beyond your starting Health.
Incoming damage: The current amount of damage waiting
to be dealt to a player.
Inflict: Take the Status Effect's corresponding token and place
it in the middle of the receiving player's Hero Board.
Instant Action card: An Action card that may be played at
any time during any player's turn. These cards can interrupt
normal play (but not Spendable Status Effects or another
Instant Action / Roll Phase Action card).
Large Straight: 5 of your dice show a sequence of numbers
(i.e. 1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6).
Main Phase Action card: An Action card that may be played
during the Active Player's Main Phase (1) or Main Phase (2).
On [symbol]: If your roll contains the required symbol(s),
you get the benefits. Even if your roll contains the required
symbol(s) multiple times, you only get the benefits once.
Or: When statements are separated by an “Or”, you may
resolve only one of the separated statements.
Persistent Status Effects: Remain in play until some other
card or ability causes their removal.
Pure Damage: Undefendable damage that cannot be
enhanced, but can be avoided.
Roll Phase Action card: An Action card that may be played
during the Offensive / Targeting / Defensive Roll Phase. These
cards can interrupt normal play (but not Spendable Status
Effects or another Instant Action / Roll Phase Action card).
Roll Phase: If an ability references “the conclusion of the Roll
Phase,” this occurs just before Main Phase (2) begins.
Roll [#]: Roll the indicated number of dice to resolve the
listed effects.
Sell: During a player's Main Phase, they may take any card
from their hand, place it onto their Discard Pile, and then
increase their CP Dial by 1.

(i.e. 1-2-3-4 or 2-3-4-5 or 3-4-5-6).
Spendable Status Effects: Remain in play until you choose
to spend them.

token and receive the benefit. This has no CP cost. You may
gain this Status Effect token again later in the game.
Stack Limit: Specifies how many tokens of the same type
can be on any one hero at any time (unless a card or ability
increases that limit).
Steal: Take the indicated resource from your opponent
and give it to yourself. If your opponent does not have the
specified amount, steal as much as they have.
Then: 'Then' statements create a break in play during which
players may play Instant Action cards, Roll Phase Action cards,
or spend Status Effects. Statements following a “Then” are
always resolved after the statements preceding the “Then”.
Ultimate Ability: Opponents CANNOT DO ANYTHING until
the ability completes. This includes reducing, preventing,
responding to, or interrupting its damage and effects. The
ability also ignores any Status Effects in play that would
reduce the effectiveness of the ability. However, the ability
can be enhanced. The only way to stop an Ultimate Ability is to
alter a die roll to stop its activation.
Undefendable Damage: Damage which players cannot
activate a Defensive Ability against. However, the damage may
still be avoided, reduced, or enhanced by cards and/or Status
Effects.
Unique Status Effects: Contain rules in their description
that break the normal rules for Status Effects.
