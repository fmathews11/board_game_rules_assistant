RULEBOOK
KEEP YOUR FEATHERED FRIENDS
CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER
IN PERCH-A BATTLE OF THE BIRDS!
Players fight for control of locations by commanding birds of their own-and other
players'-flocks. Earn points and command creatures by having the most birds on
a location, pushing your foes off the perch, and breaking ties to take the lead.
With a modular tile configuration and a variety of creatures to control, each game
will present a new tactical challenge.
Don't let this cozy homestead fool you get ready for winged warfare!

GAMEPLAY
The game takes place over 5 rounds. In each round players
will place birds from their own and other player's Flocks
onto Locations to earn points, trigger special actions, and
take control of Creatures.
Points are awarded during the Upkeep phase of each
round. The player whose Flock has earned the most points
by the end of the game wins!
Round Overview
Each round of the game has 4 phases: the MIGRATE PHASE,
the RECRUIT PHASE, the PERCH PHASE, and the UPKEEP PHASE.
MIGRATION PHASE
Remove 2 birds from each player's Flock and add them to
the Migration Bag.
FOR 2-PLAYER GAMES:
Perch
In Round 1, the "Bird-Brained" Flock will place
4 birds into the Migration Bag.
In rounds 2-5, the "Bird-Brained" Flock will
place 2 birds into the Migration Bag.
MIGRATION CONDITIONS:
• Some Locations will allow players to place extra
birds from their Flock into the Migration Bag "during
migration." Place birds as specified by the Location.
DURING MIGRATION
The controlling player places 1
additional bird from their Flock
into the migration bag.
3/4/5
• In the rare case that a player doesn't have enough birds
to place in the Migration Bag, they add what they can and
forego the rest.
RECRUIT PHASE
Shake the Migration Bag, then, in turn order each player
draws 2 birds from the Migration Bag and takes 2 birds
from their own Flock from the Roost.
Each player will have 4 birds in total, 2 from the Roost
(their own Flock) and 2 from the Migration Bag (their
own and/or other players' Flocks).
EXAMPLE: During the Recruit phase, the Blue player gains 2
Blue birds plus 1 Yellow and 1 Green bird that were drawn
from the Migration Bag.
1
PERCH PHASE
2
3
In turn order, each player places 1 of their Recruited birds
onto any Location and may execute 1 Bonus Action. This
happens in the order of the player's choice. (See "Bonus
Actions" section on the right.) Repeat until all recruited
birds are placed onto the Homestead.
PERCH CONDITIONS:
• Only one bird may be placed at a time.
• Birds may only Perch on Location Tiles. They cannot be
placed directly onto the Fountain (See "Fountain" on p.7).
• There is no limit to the number of birds that can occupy
a Location.
• Birds of the same Flock must be stacked together. A stack
must contain birds of only one color. There is no limit to
the number of birds that may be stacked in this way.
NOTE: Birds soaring high? You can use a clear
base to help stabilize a Flock that isn't already
occupying a Nest.
• A bird may be placed in a Nest if it is unoccupied, or if
the Nest is already occupied by birds of the same Flock.
• A Nest always counts as +1 bird for the Flock that
occupies it. This includes Scoring, Location Effects, and
Creature Abilities.
• If a Nest becomes empty, a player can reposition a Flock
of birds already on that Location to the empty Nest. To
do so, the player must place a bird in the Nest as part of
their "Perch" action, and then move the matching Flock
already on this Location to the Nest.
NO WRAPPING AROUND:
Birds and Creatures cannot "wrap around" the Homestead
when they are moved. This means the rightmost and
leftmost columns are NOT considered to be adjacent to
one another.
BONUS ACTIONS
Once per turn during the Perch phase, either before or
after placing a bird, a player may take a single Bonus
Action. There are 3 possible Bonus Actions, and they are
not always available: ACTIVATE A CREATURE, BUILD A BIRDHOUSE,
and ZAP A BIRD.
ACTIVATE A CREATURE
If, during the previous Upkeep phase, a player gained
control of a Creature, they may move the Creature and
activate its ability.
Refer to the Creature's reference card and follow its
activation instructions, then turn the reference card
facedown to indicate it has been activated.
CREATURE CONDITIONS:
• Each Creature may be activated only once per round.
• A player may be in control of multiple Creatures per
round; however, only one Creature may be activated
on a player's turn by using a Bonus Action.
• A player may choose not to activate a Creature during
the round.
NOTE: In each round every player will take 4 turns,
sending their 4 Recruited birds to Location Tiles. This
means a player can take a maximum of 4 Bonus Actions
per round.
BUILD A BIRDHOUSE
In rounds 4 or 5, players may use a Bonus Action to place a
Birdhouse atop ANY stack of 1 or more birds.
ONCE A BIRDHOUSE HAS BEEN PLACED:
Birds may not be added to or removed from that stack.
The stack cannot be affected by Creatures or
Lightning Tokens.
• A Birdhouse counts as +1 bird for the Flock it is
placed on, for all purposes-regardless of who placed
the Birdhouse!
ZAP A BIRD
In round 5, players may use a Bonus Action to remove one
bird from any Location using their Lightning Token. The
player whose bird was Zapped then places their bird on the
Fountain (see "Fountain" on p.7).
LIGHTNING CONDITIONS:
• A player may Zap a bird from from any player's Flock,
including their own, or they may Zap an unoccupied Nest.
If a Nest is Zapped, it is returned to the box, rather than
placed on the Fountain.
Birds may only be Zapped from a Location Tile, not from
the Fountain.
• Lightning cannot affect a bird protected by a Birdhouse.

UPKEEP PHASE
1. Score Each Location (see "Scoring" below).
2. Determine New Turn Order (see p.6).
3. Trigger Locations that activate During Upkeep
(see p.6).
4. Advance the Round Marker.
WHEN THE ROUND MARKER IS ADVANCED TO ROUNDS 4 AND 5:
ROUND 4: Each player receives a Birdhouse.
ROUND 5: Each player receives a Lightning Token.
See "Bonus Actions" to learn more about using
Birdhouses and Lightning Tokens.
1. Score Each Location
The game is scored during the Upkeep phase of each
round. At the end of round 5, end game bonuses are also
awarded (see "End of Game" on p.8).
SCORING CONDITIONS:
• Starting from the leftmost column of Locations, tally
scores from top to bottom, then repeat with the next
column until all Locations have been scored. Locations
without any birds are not scored.
Locations are scored by awarding points to the player
whose Flock has the most, second-most, and third-
most birds on the location.
The player with the most birds is awarded the points
from the top row, the middle row for second-most
birds, and the bottom row for third-most birds.
Some Locations may award a player 0 points.
For scoring purposes, Nests and Birdhouses each count
as +1 bird for that player's Flock.
TIES:
All ties cancel each other out. If two or more Flocks are
tied for most, second-most, or third-most birds, use the
guidelines below to determine how points are awarded:
TIED FOR THE MOST BIRDS
2 PLAYERS ARE TIED
No players score points for most or second-most birds.
The player whose Flock has the third-most birds
scores normally.
3+ PLAYERS ARE TIED
No players score points for most, second-most, or
third-most birds.
DURING MIGRATION
The controlling player places 1
additional bird from their Flock
int the migration bag.
*THE EARLY BIRD
3/4/5
NOTE: For the purposes of objective cards and other
effects, the player with the most birds at a Location
is considered to be "in control" of that Location.
Remember, all ties cancel, so if players are tied for
"most birds" there is no controlling player.
TIED FOR THE 2ND MOST BIRDS
2+ PLAYERS ARE TIED
No players score points for second-most or third-most
birds. The player whose Flock has the most birds
scores normally.
TIED FOR THE 3RD MOST BIRDS
2+ PLAYERS ARE TIED
No players score points for third-most birds. The players
with the most and second-most birds score normally.
POINTS AWARDED TO THE FLOCK WITH THE MOST BIRDS
POINTS AWARDED TO THE FLOCK WITH THE 2ND-MOST BIRDS
POINTS AWARDED TO THE FLOCK WITH THE 3RD-MOST BIRDS
EXAMPLE: At The Early Bird Location there are 5 birds of the
Blue Flock, 2 birds of the Red Flock, 2 birds of the Yellow
Flock, and 1 bird of the Green Flock.
The Blue Flock is awarded 3 points for having the most birds,
the Yellow and Red Flocks each have 2 birds and tie. The tie
cancels and the Yellow and Red Flocks are awarded 0 points.
The Green Flock, with the fourth-most birds on the Location,
is awarded 0 points.
NOTE: Birds are NOT removed after scoring
unless specified by the Location. They remain
in play for the duration of the game unless
removed by an ability or Lightning token.

2. Determine New Turn Order
After all Locations have been scored, turn order tokens
are redistributed in point order. This means that the player
with the most points will be first in turn order for the
following round.
If there is a tie, the player who arrived at that value first
(the token at the bottom of the stack) is considered to be
"ahead" of any players above it.
EXAMPLE: In this 4-player game, Green has the most points,
followed by Yellow, then Red (as their token is at the
bottom of the stack), and then Blue.
Turn order tokens are assigned as follows: Green (1st),
Yellow (2nd), Red (3rd), and Blue (4th).
3. Trigger Locations that Activate During Upkeep
Some Locations will activate during the Upkeep phase. Perform these actions starting with the leftmost column,
from top to bottom. Repeat until all Locations that activate During the Upkeep phase have been completed.
In general, there are two things that could happen when a Location is activated during Upkeep:
• A player gains control of a Creature.
• Birds are moved to the Fountain or Plaza.
NOTE: Unless specified otherwise, a Location's effects only apply to the player whose Flock is in control of
the Location being triggered. (See p.5 for more information about gaining control of a Location.)
GAIN CONTROL OF A CREATURE
The player with the most birds on a Creature's home Location gains control of the Creature for the upcoming
round. They take the matching Creature card and put it in front of them.

Perch_Rulebook_Feb 14-2024.indd 6

15
IF A CREATURE IS BEING CONTROLLED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A GAME:
The controlling player takes the matching Creature card, and the Creature standee is placed on its
"home tile."
8
८
17
A Creature home tile is the Location that determines control of the Creature. For example, the Cuckoo's
home tile is The Thorn Bush, and the Red Fox's home tile is The Fox's Den.
18
5
EXAMPLE: The Red Flock has the most birds on "The Doghouse" Location. They take control of the Dog by taking the
matching Creature card and placing it faceup in front of them.
19
AA
Because this is the first time the Dog has been controlled in the game, its standee is also placed on this home tile.
IN THE CASE OF A TIE: If two or more players tie for most birds, no player gains control. Instead, the Creature card is
set aside until control is assessed in the next Upkeep phase.
DURING UPKEEP
The controlling player becomes
the Dog controller.
THE DOGHOUSE
Th
1/3/1
DOG
Move Dog to any adjacent location.
Move 1 bird 1 location in any direction
away from location where Dog stops. If
the direction is off the board send the
bird to the fountain.
CONDITIONS FOR TAKING CONTROL OF A CREATURE:
Players only gain control of Creatures during the
Upkeep phase.
• When determining control of a Creature, do not take the
previous round's ownership or the Creature's current
Location into account.
• You must control a Creature's home Location in order to
become the controller. Creatures will move to different
Locations throughout the game. Control of the Creature's
home tile is the only factor in determining who controls
any Creature in the Homestead.
Creatures remain at the Location they are currently on
until activated by the controlling player. (See FAQ on p.8
for Creature clarifications.)

FOUNTAIN CONDITIONS:
• Throughout the game, in any situation where a bird
is sent to the Fountain, either by being Zapped or by
a Creature/Location ability, the player whose bird was
affected is the one who places it on the Fountain.
IN A 2-PLAYER GAME:
If the Bird-Brained player's bird is sent to the
Fountain, the player that caused the bird to be
sent there determines where it is placed.
• Whenever a bird is placed on the Fountain, it must be
supported. This means that before placing a bird in an
empty Perch spot, all of the Perch spots beneath it that
are connected by line(s) must be filled first.
EXAMPLE:
THE PLAZA
The Plaza is the space beneath the Fountain. Birds are
placed here only if specifically instructed, or at the end of
the game (see "Award End Game Bonuses" on p.8).
At the end of the game, each bird in the Plaza will score
1 victory point.
7
• There is no limit to the number of birds that may occupy
the Plaza.
4. Advance the Round Marker
Advance the Round Marker by 1 space
(shown to the right).
• At the start of round 4, distribute a
Birdhouse to each player.
• At the start of round 5, distribute a
Lightning Token to each player.

END OF GAME
Conduct the Upkeep phase in round 5 as normal before
proceeding to end game scoring.
NOTE: Remember to trigger all Locations that
activate during Upkeep. This includes assigning
control of Creatures.
End Game Scoring
First, move any birds remaining in the Migration Bag to
the Plaza.
Next, if hidden objectives are in play, determine whether
each player has achieved their goal. If so, players earn
points as indicated on their objective card.
Then, refer to the top left corner of the Fountain Board,
which shows End Game Scoring as follows:
NOTE: Hidden objectives are not shared.
Players may only score points from their
own objective card.
END GAME SCORING
10 For the Largest Flock
3 Per Creature Controlled
X Per Bird in the Fountain
1 Per Bird in the Plaza
• 10 points are awarded for the single largest Flock (on a
single Location). If two or more players are tied for the
largest Flock, no points are awarded.
• Each player is awarded 3 points for each Creature they
control at the end of the game.
• Players are awarded X points for each bird in the
Fountain, where X is equal to the points indicated to the
right of that level. Higher levels in the Fountain award
more points, and each bird is scored individually.
Birds in the Plaza are all worth 1 victory point each.
60+
If a player's score goes over 60 points, they
flip their scoring token to the "60+" side and
continue scoring.
THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST POINTS WINS!

APPLYING SPECIAL EFFECTS
Some card effects and tokens may increase, decrease,
or change a player's actions in each round. In all cases,
the text on the card or Locations supersedes any rules in
this rulebook.
2-Player Clarifications
• If a player is tied with the bird-brained player for most,
second-most, or third-most birds, standard rules
regarding ties apply (see p.5).
• If a Location Tile's effects would apply to the bird-brained
player's Flock during the Recruit or Perch phases, or
during Scoring, they are ignored.
• If the bird-brained player is instructed to send any
number of birds to the Fountain or the Plaza due to the
effects of a Location tile, the birds are instead returned
to the Roost (The Swaying Power Lines, The Overstuffed
Birdhouse, The Precariously Hanging Nest, The Rookery).
THE HIGH PERCH
If the bird-brained player has the most birds at this
Location, its effects are ignored for the round.
//
REMOVING LOCATIONS WITH CREATURES, NESTS, OR BIRDHOUSES
What happens if a Location is removed, and there are
items on it? Some actions may require that a Location
be removed from play. If this happens and a Creature is
on the tile, that Creature returns to its home tile. Nests
and Birdhouses should be returned to the box.
Creatures
THE OWL BARN
When Building the Homestead, The Owl Barn must
be placed on an outside edge. If it is not on an edge,
shuffle The Owl Barn and all other Locations in the
same column. Redistribute the Locations from top to
bottom. If The Owl Barn is still not on the edge, repeat
as needed.
THE BEE
What is color matching? When the Bee stops at a
Location, it may move a bird from any other Location
to the Bee's Location, as long as there is a bird of that
same color (Flock) already present at the Bee's Location.
THE SCARECROW
As soon as a player gains control of the Scarecrow, they
place it at the intersection of three Locations of their
choice. The Scarecrow is unlike the other Creatures in
that it is not placed on its home tile.
Every time the Scarecrow controller changes, the
Scarecrow is moved to a new intersection. This is the
only time the Scarecrow is moved. If the Scarecrow
controller is the same as the previous round, it remains
in place.

In case of a tie, the tied player with the largest Flock at a single
location wins. If players are still tied, the player with the most birds
on the Fountain wins.
STILL TIED? We'll call it a shared victory-or for a twist, ties cancel and
you should play again!
