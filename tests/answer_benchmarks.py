In Spirit Island, Dahan are the native human inhabitants of the island. Here are some key points about Dahan:

Description: They coexist well with the land and the Spirits but are wary of the invading colonizers. 
Dahan are not accustomed to violence but will defend themselves when attacked.

Abilities:

Each Dahan piece can deal 2 Damage to Invaders and has 2 Health.
They only attack when prompted by a Spirit Power or when they are attacked by Invaders.
Game Mechanics:

When Invaders Ravage a land where Dahan are present, the Dahan will fight back after suffering damage. Dahan are 
essential in the strategic defense of the island as they can help generate Fear and contribute to the overall 
resistance against the Invaders. Starting Setup: The game begins with 6 Dahan pieces placed on the island board, 
but their population can change throughout the game based on the actions of players and the Invaders.

In summary, Dahan are crucial to the gameplay and represent the island's native population who collaborate with 
Spirits to resist the Invaders.

Would you like to know more about their interactions with Invaders or how to effectively use them in gameplay?

HOW_TO_GAIN_PRESENCE_IN_SPIRIT_ISLAND_ANSWER = """Based on the manual, you primarily gain Presence on the island 
during the Spirit Phase by choosing a "Grow" option. Here's how it works: *   **During the Spirit Phase:** The first 
step for each Spirit is to "Grow". You choose one option from the "Growth" section on your Spirit Panel. (p. 8) *   
**"Add Presence" Growth Option:** Many Spirits have a Growth option that specifically allows you to add Presence to 
the board. This option will specify how many Presence you can add and the Range from your existing Presence where it 
must be placed. (p. 14) *   **Taking Presence from your Spirit Panel:** When you add Presence to the island using a 
Growth option (or any other effect that adds Presence), you take a Presence disk from the leftmost uncovered space on 
either your Energy Presence Track or your Card Plays Presence Track. As you take Presence from these tracks, 
you reveal higher numbers, increasing your Energy gain or Card Plays limit for future turns. (p. 13, 
14) *   **Initial Setup:** At the very start of the game during Setup, you place Presence on your starting board 
according to the instructions on the back of your Spirit Panel. After this initial placement, your remaining Presence 
goes onto the dashed circles of your Presence Tracks. (p. 6) In summary: *   You add Presence to the island by 
choosing a **"Grow" option** during the Spirit Phase. (p. 8, 14) *   Presence comes from your **Presence Tracks** on 
the Spirit Panel, revealing benefits as you place them on the board. (p. 13, 14) *   Initial presence placement 
happens during **Setup**. (p. 6) Would you like to know more about: *   The different types of Growth options? *   
What Sacred Sites are? *   What fear is and how it's gained?"""

WHAT_IS_FEAR_IN_SPIRIT_ISLAND_ANSWER = """In Spirit Island, **Fear** represents the terror felt by the Invaders as 
they encounter the power of the spirits and the dangers of the island. Here's a breakdown of what Fear is and how it 
functions: *   **Generation:** Fear is primarily generated by Spirit Powers that have the Fear symbol ( ) and by the 
destruction of Invader pieces. Destroying a Town generates 1 Fear, and destroying a City generates 2 Fear. (p. 12, 
18) *   **Tracking:** Fear is tracked using Fear Markers. When Fear is generated, Fear Markers are moved from the 
Fear Pool on the Invader Board to the Generated Fear area. (p. 4, 12) *   **Earning Fear Cards:** When all of the 
Fear Markers have been moved from the Fear Pool to the Generated Fear area, the Spirits earn a Fear Card. The top 
card of the Fear Deck is moved face-down to the Earned Fear Cards area. All Fear Markers are then returned to the 
Fear Pool (any leftover Fear is moved to the Generated Fear area). (p. 12) *   **Terror Levels:** The Fear Deck 
contains Terror Level dividers (Terror Level 2 and Terror Level 3). When earning a Fear Card reveals one of these 
dividers, the current Terror Level increases. The Terror Level determines which effect on an earned Fear Card is 
used, and also changes the Victory Condition needed to win the game. The new Terror Level and Victory Condition take 
effect immediately upon revealing the divider. (p. 6, 12) *   **Resolving Fear Cards:** Earned Fear Cards are 
resolved during the Invader Phase (specifically, after the Blighted Island check and before Invader Actions). The 
earned stack is picked up, flipped over, and cards are resolved one at a time in the order they were earned. Only the 
effect listed next to the current Terror Level is used. After resolution, they are discarded to the Fear Discard 
Space. (p. 9, 12)"""
