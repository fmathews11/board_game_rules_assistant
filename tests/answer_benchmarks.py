WHAT_ARE_DAHAN_IN_SPIRIT_ISLAND_ANSWER = """
In Spirit Island, Dahan are the native human inhabitants of the island. Here are some key points about Dahan:

Description: They coexist well with the land and the Spirits but are wary of the invading colonizers. 
Dahan are not accustomed to violence but will defend themselves when attacked.

Abilities:

Each Dahan piece can deal 2 Damage to Invaders and has 2 Health.
They only attack when prompted by a Spirit Power or when they are attacked by Invaders.
Game Mechanics:

When Invaders Ravage a land where Dahan are present, the Dahan will fight back after suffering damage. Dahan are 
essential in the strategic defense of the island as they can help generate Fear and contribute to the overall 
resistance against the Invaders. Starting Setup: The game begins with 6 Dahan pieces placed on the island board, 
but their population can change throughout the game based on the actions of players and the Invaders.

In summary, Dahan are crucial to the gameplay and represent the island's native population who collaborate with 
Spirits to resist the Invaders.

Would you like to know more about their interactions with Invaders or how to effectively use them in gameplay?

HOW_TO_GAIN_PRESENCE_IN_SPIRIT_ISLAND_ANSWER = """Based on the manual, you primarily gain Presence on the island 
during the Spirit Phase by choosing a "Grow" option. Here's how it works: *   **During the Spirit Phase:** The first 
step for each Spirit is to "Grow". You choose one option from the "Growth" section on your Spirit Panel. (p. 8) *   
**"Add Presence" Growth Option:** Many Spirits have a Growth option that specifically allows you to add Presence to 
the board. This option will specify how many Presence you can add and the Range from your existing Presence where it 
must be placed. (p. 14) *   **Taking Presence from your Spirit Panel:** When you add Presence to the island using a 
Growth option (or any other effect that adds Presence), you take a Presence disk from the leftmost uncovered space on 
either your Energy Presence Track or your Card Plays Presence Track. As you take Presence from these tracks, 
you reveal higher numbers, increasing your Energy gain or Card Plays limit for future turns. (p. 13, 
14) *   **Initial Setup:** At the very start of the game during Setup, you place Presence on your starting board 
according to the instructions on the back of your Spirit Panel. After this initial placement, your remaining Presence 
goes onto the dashed circles of your Presence Tracks. (p. 6) In summary: *   You add Presence to the island by 
choosing a **"Grow" option** during the Spirit Phase. (p. 8, 14) *   Presence comes from your **Presence Tracks** on 
the Spirit Panel, revealing benefits as you place them on the board. (p. 13, 14) *   Initial presence placement 
happens during **Setup**. (p. 6) Would you like to know more about: *   The different types of Growth options? *   
What Sacred Sites are? *   What fear is and how it's gained?"""

WHAT_IS_FEAR_IN_SPIRIT_ISLAND_ANSWER = """In Spirit Island, **Fear** represents the terror felt by the Invaders as 
they encounter the power of the spirits and the dangers of the island. Here's a breakdown of what Fear is and how it 
functions: *   **Generation:** Fear is primarily generated by Spirit Powers that have the Fear symbol ( ) and by the 
destruction of Invader pieces. Destroying a Town generates 1 Fear, and destroying a City generates 2 Fear. (p. 12, 
18) *   **Tracking:** Fear is tracked using Fear Markers. When Fear is generated, Fear Markers are moved from the 
Fear Pool on the Invader Board to the Generated Fear area. (p. 4, 12) *   **Earning Fear Cards:** When all of the 
Fear Markers have been moved from the Fear Pool to the Generated Fear area, the Spirits earn a Fear Card. The top 
card of the Fear Deck is moved face-down to the Earned Fear Cards area. All Fear Markers are then returned to the 
Fear Pool (any leftover Fear is moved to the Generated Fear area). (p. 12) *   **Terror Levels:** The Fear Deck 
contains Terror Level dividers (Terror Level 2 and Terror Level 3). When earning a Fear Card reveals one of these 
dividers, the current Terror Level increases. The Terror Level determines which effect on an earned Fear Card is 
used, and also changes the Victory Condition needed to win the game. The new Terror Level and Victory Condition take 
effect immediately upon revealing the divider. (p. 6, 12) *   **Resolving Fear Cards:** Earned Fear Cards are 
resolved during the Invader Phase (specifically, after the Blighted Island check and before Invader Actions). The 
earned stack is picked up, flipped over, and cards are resolved one at a time in the order they were earned. Only the 
effect listed next to the current Terror Level is used. After resolution, they are discarded to the Fear Discard 
Space. (p. 9, 12)"""

RAZE_ANSWER = """
Based on the Spirit Island rulebook and the information about Terrifying Nightmares, here is the sequence of events:

Raze resolves: You used 'Raze' (a Fast Power) to destroy a town on a Blighted land with 2 Blight. Destroying the Town 
generates 1 Fear. (Page 15) Fear is generated: The 1 Fear generated from destroying the Town is added to the 
Generated Fear area on the Invader board. (Page 12) Terrifying Nightmares triggers: Since Fear was generated, 
'Terrifying Nightmares' (a Fear card in play) triggers its effect: "After Fear is generated, 1 Damage to Invaders in 
a land with no Blight." (Spirit Island Wiki: Terrifying Nightmares) You would choose a land with no Blight and deal 1 
Damage to Invaders there. The distribution of this 1 Damage among Invaders in that land is up to you. (Page 18) 
Blight is added: The land where you used 'Raze' already had 2 Blight. Adding another Blight (because the land took 2 
or more Damage from the Invaders during the Ravage, which is implied by the presence of Blight and the use of Raze to 
destroy a Town) causes a Blight cascade. (Page 9, Page 15) You must add one Blight to an adjacent land. If that land 
also has Blight, it cascades again. This continues until a Blight is added to a land with no Blight or there are no 
adjacent lands. (Page 15) For each land that gains Blight due to the cascade, destroy one Presence from each Spirit 
in that land. (Page 15) Update Blight Pool: The Blight added to the board comes from the Blight Card. Since you added 
Blight, the total amount of Blight on the Blight Card decreases. (Page 15) Update Terror Level: As Fear Markers are 
moved to the Generated Fear area, they can cause Fear Cards to be earned. When enough Fear Markers are in the 
Generated Fear area (4 per player), a Fear Card is earned and moved face-down to the Earned Fear Cards area. If this 
reveals a Terror Level divider, the Terror Level increases immediately. (Page 12) In your scenario, 1 Fear was 
generated. If this is enough to earn a Fear Card based on the number of players and the current state of the Fear 
Pool, a Fear Card is earned. If earning this card reveals a Terror Level divider, the Terror Level increases. Resolve 
Earned Fear Cards (during the next Invader Phase): Any Fear Cards earned are resolved during the Fear step of the 
next Invader Phase. (Page 9, Page 12) The effects of the earned Fear Card(s) are applied based on the current Terror 
Level. (Page 9, Page 12) Final States:

The Land where Raze was used: The Town is destroyed. The land now has 3 Blight (the initial 2 plus the one added from 
the Ravage/Raze effect). Any Presence in this land would be destroyed due to the Blight being added. Adjacent Land(
s): At least one adjacent land will gain 1 Blight due to the cascade. Any Presence in lands that gain Blight will be 
destroyed. The Blight Pool: The number of Blight on the Blight Card decreases by the total number of Blight added to 
the board (at least 2: 1 in the original land and at least 1 from the cascade). The Terror Level: The Terror Level 
may increase if the generated Fear caused a Fear Card to be earned and that revealed a Terror Level divider."""

BLIGHT_LOSS_ANSWER = """Blight Loss Condition: The Blight card states "3 Blight per player before loss." In a 
2-player game, the loss condition is met if there are 6 or more Blight on the island (3 Blight/player * 2 players = 6 
Blight). You currently have 7 Blight, which means you have already met the Blight loss condition. (Page 5) Ravage 
Action: During the Ravage step of the Invader Phase, Invaders deal damage to the land and Dahan. If a land receives 2 
or more damage, 1 Blight is added to that land. If a land already has Blight and gains another Blight, it causes a 
Blight cascade, adding Blight to an adjacent land. Adding Blight also destroys one Presence from each Spirit in that 
land. (Page 9, 15) Invader Damage: Towns deal 2 Damage during Ravage. (Page 15) Destroying Invaders: Destroying a 
Town generates 1 Fear. (Page 15) Removing Blight: Some effects can remove Blight from the island, returning it to the 
Blight card. (Page 18) Given that you have already met the Blight loss condition with 7 Blight (and the threshold is 
6 Blight for a 2-player game), your primary goal of avoiding the Blight loss condition this turn is not possible 
based on the rules provided. The game is already lost.

However, if we assume the Blight threshold was higher or you had a way to remove Blight before the Ravage, 
let's analyze the Major Powers:

Thematic Corruption: This power targets 1 Blighted land and deals 4 Damage to Invaders. If it destroys any Invaders, 
you remove 1 Blight. In the scenario, one Coastal land has 1 Town and 1 Blight. Playing Thematic Corruption on this 
land would deal 4 Damage to the Town (which has 2 Health), destroying it. This would generate 1 Fear and, because an 
Invader was destroyed, you would remove 1 Blight from the land. This would reduce the total Blight on the island by 
1. Quake: This power targets 1 land and deals 3 Damage to Invaders. It also replaces 1 Town with 1 Explorer. If 
played on a Coastal land with a Town, it would deal 3 Damage to the Town, destroying it and generating 1 Fear. It 
would then replace the destroyed Town with an Explorer. This power does not directly remove Blight. To prioritize 
avoiding the Blight loss condition (assuming it was still avoidable), Thematic Corruption would be the better choice 
because it has the potential to remove Blight from the island if it destroys an Invader. Quake does not offer Blight 
removal."""
